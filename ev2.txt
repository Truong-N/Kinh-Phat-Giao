Majjhima Nikaya
21. The Parable of the Saw
(Kakacùpama sutta)
Thus I heard.
At one time, the Blessed One was residing in Savatthi, at Jetavana, the garden of Anathapindika.
At that time, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in excessive association with the bhikkhunis. The Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in association with the bhikkhunis as follows: If any bhikkhu spoke ill of those bhikkhunis in the presence of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna would immediately become angry and displeased, and immediately question him; if any bhikkhu spoke ill of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna in the presence of those bhikkhunis, those bhikkhunis would immediately become angry and displeased, and immediately question him. The Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in association with the bhikkhunis in this way. 
Another monk came to where the Buddha was staying. After arriving, he paid homage to the Buddha and sat down to one side. After sitting down to one side, the monk said to the Buddha:
"Venerable Lord, Venerable Moliya Phagguna associates with the nuns excessively. Venerable Lord, Venerable Moliya Phagguna associates with the nuns in such a way: If any monk speaks ill of those nuns in the presence of Venerable Moliya Phagguna, Venerable Moliya Phagguna immediately becomes angry, displeased, and questions him; if any monk speaks ill of Venerable Moliya Phagguna in the presence of those nuns, those nuns immediately become angry, displeased, and question him. Venerable Lord, Venerable Moliya Phagguna associates with the nuns in such an excessive way." 
The Buddha called another monk and said,
"Monk, go, in my name, and call the monk Moliya Phagguna: 'Venerable Phagguna, the Master is calling you.'"
"Yes, Lord."
The monk obeyed the Buddha and went to where the Venerable Moliya Phagguna was. When he arrived, he said to the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, 
"Venerable Moliya Phagguna, the Master is calling you."
"Yes, Venerable."
The monk Moliya Phagguna obeyed the monk and went to where the Buddha was. When he arrived, he paid homage to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, who was sitting to one side, 
"Phaguna, is it true that people say you live in excessive association with the nuns?" It is rumored that he lived in such a way with the nuns as follows: "If any monk speaks ill of the nuns in his presence, he immediately becomes angry, displeased, and accuses them; if any monk speaks ill of him in front of the nuns, the nuns immediately become angry, displeased, and accuse them." Is this how you lived with the nuns, Phagguna?
- Yes, Lord.
- Are you a virtuous man who, out of faith, renounced your family and lives without a family?
- Yes, Lord.
- Phagguna, it is truly unworthy of you, a virtuous man, who, out of faith, renounced your family and lives without a family, to live in such excessively with the nuns. Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone speaks ill of those bhikkhunis in your presence, Phagguna, you must abandon worldly desires and worldly thoughts. Phagguna, you must learn as follows: “May my mind not be defiled! May I not speak evil words! May I live with compassion, with loving-kindness, without harboring anger!” Phagguna, you must learn in this way.
Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone strikes those bhikkhunis in your presence, throws earth at them, beats them with a stick, or strikes them with a sword, Phagguna, you must abandon desires… without harboring anger. Phagguna, you must learn in this way. Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone speaks ill of someone in your presence, Phagguna, you must abandon desires… without harboring anger. Phagguna, you must learn in this way. Therefore, Phagguna, if someone strikes you with their hand, throws dirt at you, hits you with a stick, or strikes you with a sword, Phagguna, you must abandon worldly desires and worldly thoughts. Phagguna, you must learn as follows: “May my mind not be defiled! May I not speak evil words! May I live with compassion, with loving-kindness, without harboring anger!” Phagguna, you must learn in this way.
Then the Blessed One said to the monks:
-------------------------------
"Now, monks, there was a time when my monks were very pure and joyful. Now, monks, I tell you, monks, I practiced the asceticism of sitting still and eating. Monks, by practicing the asceticism of sitting still and eating, I felt free from sickness and pain, light, healthy, and refreshed. Monks, you should also practice the asceticism of sitting still and eating. Monks, by practicing the asceticism of sitting still and eating, you will feel free from sickness and pain, light, healthy, and refreshed. Monks, I do not need to teach them anything; monks, I only need to awaken their mindfulness. Monks, it is like a chariot parked on level ground at a crossroads, harnessed to fine horses, with a whip ready at the end." There is a skilled charioteer, a driver who can control horses worthy of being driven. He climbs into the chariot, his left hand grasping the reins, his right hand holding the whip, and can drive the chariot back and forth, wherever and however he wishes. Similarly, monks, I do not need to teach these monks anything; I only need to awaken their mindfulness.
Therefore, monks, abandon unwholesome actions and strive for wholesome actions; only then will you achieve maturity, prosperity, and strength in this Dharma and Vinaya. Monks, it is like near a small village or town, there is a large tala forest, a forest covered with ylang-ylang vines. A person comes to this forest, wanting to benefit the forest, wanting happiness, wanting to free the forest from its fetters. He cut off the weak, lifeless branches of the trees, threw them out of the forest, and cleaned the forest thoroughly. He carefully tended to the straight, healthy-growing branches of the tala trees. Bhikkhus, after a time, such a forest matured, flourished, and grew strong. Likewise, Bhikkhus, you should abandon unwholesome things and strive for wholesome things; only then will you achieve maturity, flourishing, and strength in this Dharma and Vinaya.
Bhikkhus, in ancient times, in this city of Savatthi, there was a householder named Vedehika. Bhikkhus, the following good reputation arose concerning the householder Vedehika: “The householder Vedehika is virtuous, the householder Vedehika is gentle; the householder Vedehika is mild-mannered.” "Bhikkhus, the householder Vedehika has a maid named Kali, who is skillful, diligent, and meticulous in her work. Bhikkhus, the maid Kali thought to herself, 'My mistress has a good reputation: 'The householder Vedehika is virtuous; the householder Vedehika is gentle; the householder Vedehika is mild-mannered.' I wonder if my mistress has anger that she doesn't show, or if she has no anger at all, or if it's because of my meticulous work that she has anger but doesn't show it. Let me test my mistress!'"
Bhikkhus, the maid Kali then woke up very late the next morning. Bhikkhus, the householder Vedehika said to the maid Kali:
"Kali!"
"Mistress, what is it?"
"Why did you wake up so late today?"
"Mistress, nothing is wrong." "--Is there really nothing wrong? You wicked maid, you woke up late today!"
And the mistress, indignant and dissatisfied, glared.
The maid Kali thought to herself, "My mistress truly has inner anger, but she doesn't show it. Because of the careful and thorough work I do, my mistress, though she has inner anger, doesn't show it. It's not that she doesn't have it." "Then let me test my mistress again!"
Monks, the maid Kali woke up even later the next day. Monks, the mistress Vedehika said to the maid Kali:
-- Kali!
-- Mistress, what is it?
-- Why did you wake up so late today?
-- Mistress, there's nothing wrong.
-- Really nothing wrong? You wicked maid, you woke up late today!
And the mistress, in anger and dissatisfaction, uttered words of displeasure.
Monks, the maid Kali thought: "My mistress truly has inner anger, but she doesn't show it. Because of the careful and thorough work I do, my mistress, though she has inner anger, doesn't show it. It's not that she doesn't have it." "Then let's try my mistress again!"
Bhikkhus, the maid Kali woke up even later the next morning. Bhikkhus, the mistress Vedehika said to the maid Kali:
-- Kali!
-- Mistress, what is it?
-- Why did you wake up so late today?
-- Mistress, there's nothing wrong.
-- Really nothing wrong? You wicked maid, you woke up late today!
Then, in anger and displeasure, she took the door latch and struck the maid on the head, splitting her skull open.
Bhikkhus, the maid Kali, with her head bleeding from the wound, went and complained to the neighbors:
-- Look at the virtuous mistress! Look at the gentle mistress! Look at the kind mistress! How could the mistress say to her only maid, "You woke up late today," and then, in anger and dissatisfaction, she took the door latch and struck me on the head, splitting my skull open? "First."
Bhikkhus, after some time, the following bad rumors arose about the mistress Vedehika: "The mistress Vedehika is wicked! The mistress Vedehika is not compliant! The mistress Vedehika is not gentle!"
-------------------------------
Likewise, monks, here, a monk is extremely gentle, extremely compliant, extremely mild-mannered while he has not yet been subjected to unpleasant or offensive words. And, monks, only when a monk is subjected to unpleasant or offensive words, and he remains extremely gentle, extremely compliant, extremely mild-mannered, only then is he considered gentle, compliant, and mild-mannered. Monks, I do not call a monk eloquent when he is eloquent in speaking about necessities such as clothing, food, bedding, or medicine, when he has attained the quality of eloquence. Why is that, monks? When that monk does not have these necessities such as clothing, food, bedding, or medicine, he is no longer eloquent, he has no longer attained the quality of eloquence. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who respects the Dharma, venerates the Dharma, and cherishes the Dharma becomes eloquent, who achieves the quality of eloquence—that is what I call eloquent. Therefore, bhikkhus, reflect: "Only by respecting the Dharma, venerating the Dharma, and cherishing the Dharma will we become eloquent, who achieve the quality of eloquence." Bhikkhus, you must learn in this way.
Bhikkhus, there are five kinds of language that you can use when speaking to others: timely or untimely, truthful or untrue, gentle or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with compassion or with anger. Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you can speak at the right time or at the wrong time. Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you can speak truthfully or untruthfully. Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak gently or harshly. Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak beneficially or unbeneficially. Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak with loving-kindness or with anger. Bhikkhus, here you should learn as follows: “We will keep our minds undefiled; we will not utter harsh words; we will live with compassion, with loving-kindness, with no anger within. We will surround this person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness. And with this person as the object, we will pervade the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, boundless and infinite, without hatred or anger.” Bhikkhus, this is what you should learn.
"Monks, imagine a man coming with a shovel and a basket, saying, 'I will make this great land no longer land,' and he digs here and there, scatters earth here and there, spits here and there, urinates here and there, thinking, 'You will become not land, you will become not land.' Monks, what do you think? Can he make this great land no longer land?"
"No, Venerable Lord. Why? Because this great land is deep and immeasurable; it is not easy to make this great land no longer land before he becomes weary and fails."
"Similarly, monks, there are five kinds of speech that you can use with others: 'at the right time or at the wrong time... or with anger.' Monks, when you speak to others, you can say, 'at the right time... or with anger.'" Bhikkhus, here you should learn as follows: “We will keep our minds undefiled; we will not utter evil words; we will live with compassion, with loving-kindness, with no anger within; we will pervade this person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness. And with this person as the object, we will pervade the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger.” Bhikkhus, you should learn in this way.
Bhikkhus, imagine a person coming with paint, yellow, dark blue, or crimson; he might say: “I will write colors in this void. I will make colors appear.” Bhikkhus, what do you think? Can he write colors in the void and make colors appear?
-- Venerable Lord, it cannot. Why is that? Venerable Lord, emptiness is formless, invisible. Here, it is not easy to write down forms and make them appear before one becomes weary and fails.
--Similarly, monks, there are five kinds of speech that you can speak to others: "At the right time or at the wrong time... or with anger... (as above)... And with this person as the object, I pervade the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger." Monks, you should learn in this way.
"Monks, imagine a man coming with a burning bundle of dry grass and saying, 'With this burning bundle of dry grass, I will heat and boil the Ganges River.' Monks, what do you think? Can that man, with this burning bundle of dry grass, heat and boil the Ganges River?"
-- "No, Lord. Why? Because the Ganges River is deep and immeasurable; it is not easy for a burning bundle of dry grass to heat and boil the Ganges River before that man becomes exhausted and fails."
-------------------------------
-- Likewise, monks, there are five kinds of speech that you may use when speaking to others: "at the right time or at the wrong time... or with anger." Monks, when speaking to others, you may say: "At the right time... or with anger... (as above)... And with this person as the object, I pervade the entire world with a mind endowed with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger." Monks, you should learn in this way.
"—Monks, imagine a cat's skin bag, tanned thoroughly, very finely, soft like cotton, without any hissing or rustling sounds. Then a man comes, holding a stick or a piece of pottery, and says, 'I will use this stick or the piece of pottery to make this cat's skin bag, which is tanned thoroughly, very finely, soft like cotton, and without any hissing or rustling sounds, make it hiss or rustle.' Monks, what do you think? Can that man, with his stick or the piece of pottery, make this cat's skin bag, which is tanned thoroughly, very finely, soft like cotton, and without any hissing or rustling sounds, make it hiss or rustle?"
"—No, Venerable Lord. Why not?" "Venerable Lord, this catskin bag has been tanned nine times, skillfully tanned, thoroughly tanned, soft and pliable like cotton, without any hissing or popping sound. It is not easy to make that bag hiss or pop before the person becomes exhausted and fails."
"Similarly, monks, there are five kinds of language that you can use when speaking to others: 'Timely or untimely, truthful or untrue, gentle or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with compassion or with anger.' Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak at the right time or at the wrong time. Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak truthfully or untruthfully. Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak gently or harshly." Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak beneficial words or unbeneficial words. Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak with loving-kindness or with anger. Bhikkhus, here you should learn as follows: “We will keep our minds undefiled; we will not utter evil words; we will live with compassion, with loving-kindness, with an inner mind free from anger. We will pervade this person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness. And with this person as the object, we will pervade the whole world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger.” Bhikkhus, you should learn in this way.
Bhikkhus, just as vile thieves use a double-edged saw to cut off hands and feet; yet, if anyone here harbors defiled thoughts, that person is therefore not a practitioner of my teachings. Here, monks, you should learn as follows: “We will keep our minds undefiled; we will not utter harsh words; we will live with compassion, with loving-kindness, with no anger in our hearts. We will live enveloping this person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness. And with this person as the object, we will pervade the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger.” Monks, you should learn in this way.
And, monks, if you always contemplate this teaching like the saw, then, monks, will you find any kind of language, whether subtle or harsh, that you cannot endure?
-- No, Lord.
-- Monks, therefore, always contemplate this teaching like the saw, and you will have lasting happiness and peace.
Thus the Lord taught. Those monks rejoiced and accepted the Buddha's teachings with faith.
