13. The Great Discourse on the Aggregate of Suffering
3
25
72
(Mahàdukkhakkhanda sutta)
4
17
89
Thus I heard:
5
98
187
At one time, the Blessed One was in Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika.
6
399
586
At that time, many monks, in the morning, put on their robes, took their alms bowls, and went into Savatthi to beg for alms.
Then those monks thought:
"It is too early to go begging for alms in Savatthi.
Let us go to the garden of the wandering ascetics of other sects."
Those monks went to the garden of the wandering ascetics of other sects, exchanged greetings and pleasantries, and then sat down to one side.
Those wandering ascetics of other sects spoke to the monks who were sitting to one side.
7
535
1121
-- Venerable ones, the ascetic Gotama clearly stated his complete understanding of desires, and we also clearly stated our complete understanding of desires.
Venerable ones, the ascetic Gotama clearly stated his complete understanding of material phenomena, and we also clearly stated our complete understanding of material phenomena.
Venerable ones, the ascetic Gotama clearly stated his complete understanding of feelings, and we also clearly stated our complete understanding of feelings.
Venerable ones, is there any particular difference, any distinction, any disparity between the ascetic Gotama and us regarding the matter of preaching or teaching?
8
225
1346
Those monks neither rejoiced nor criticized the words of the wandering ascetics of other sects. Neither rejoicing nor criticizing, the monks rose from their seats and departed, thinking:
"We will learn the meaning of these words from the Blessed One."
9
203
1549
Then those monks, after begging for alms in Savatthi, having eaten and returned from begging for alms, went to where the Blessed One was, paid homage to Him, and sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One:
10
1223
2772
-- Blessed One, here in the morning we put on our robes, took our alms bowls, and went into Savatthi to beg for alms.
Blessed One, then we thought:
"It is too early to go begging for alms in Savatthi.
Let us think of the garden of the wandering ascetics of other sects." "Venerable Lord, we then went to the garden of the wandering ascetics of other sects. After arriving, we exchanged greetings and pleasantries, and sat down to one side. Venerable Lord, those wandering ascetics of other sects said to us, who were sitting to one side:
"Venerable ones, the ascetic Gotama clearly demonstrates a complete understanding of desires, and we also clearly demonstrate a complete understanding of desires.
Venerable ones, the ascetic Gotama clearly demonstrates a complete understanding of material phenomena, and we also clearly demonstrate a complete understanding of material phenomena.
Venerable ones, the ascetic Gotama clearly demonstrates a complete understanding of feelings, and we also clearly demonstrate a complete understanding of feelings.
Venerable ones, is there any particular difference, any distinction, any disparity between the ascetic Gotama and us regarding the matter of preaching or teaching?" 
Venerable Lord, we neither rejoiced nor criticized the words of those wandering ascetics of other sects.
Without joy, without criticism, we rose from our seats and departed with the thought:
"We will learn the meaning of these words from the Buddha."
11
781
3553
-- O monks, the wandering ascetics of other sects who speak in this way should be answered as follows:
"Venerable ones, what is the sweetness of sensual pleasures?
What is the danger, what is liberation?
What is the sweetness of material things, what is the danger, what is liberation?
What is the sweetness of feelings, what is the danger, what is liberation?" O monks, when asked this, the wandering ascetics of other sects cannot answer and will fall into other difficulties.
Why is that?
O monks, because this matter is not within their capacity to understand.
"Bhikkhus, I do not see anyone in this world, among the gods, Mara, Brahma, among the ascetics, Brahmins, gods, and humans, whose answers to questions are acceptable, except the Tathagata, the disciples of the Tathagata, and those who hear these two.
12
17
3570
(The Sweetness of Sensations)
13
549
4119
And, Bhikkhus, what is the sweetness of sensual pleasures?
Bhikkhus, there are five things that increase sensual pleasure:
The visual objects perceived by the eye, which are lovely, pleasant, agreeable, delightful, corresponding to sensual pleasure, and attractive; the sounds perceived by the ear...
the scents perceived by the nose...
the tastes perceived by the tongue...
the tactile sensations perceived by the body, which are lovely, pleasant, agreeable, delightful, corresponding to sensual pleasure, and attractive.
Bhikkhus, there are five such things that increase sensual pleasure.
" "Bhikkhus, based on these five factors that increase desire, joy arises; this is the sweetness of desires."
14
597
597
"Now, monks, what is the danger of sensual desires?
Here, monks, there is a virtuous man who earns a living through occupations such as counting on his fingers, calculating, estimating, farming, trading, cattle herding, archery, working for the king, or any other occupation.
He must endure the cold, endure the heat, suffer the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, heat, the sun, reptiles, and die of hunger and thirst.
"Now, monks, this is the danger of sensual desires, a real and present danger, belonging to the aggregate of suffering, taking desire as its cause, its condition, its origin, its origin."
15
379
976
"Bhikkhus, if that good man makes such an effort, such diligence, such exertion, but those possessions do not come to him, he laments, grieves, weeps, beats his chest, and faints:
"Alas!
My efforts are truly useless, my diligence is truly fruitless."
"Bhikkhus, this is the danger of desires...
(as above)...
the cause of desires.
16
785
1761
"Bhikkhus, if that good man makes such an effort, such diligence, such exertion, and those possessions come to him, because he must protect those possessions, he experiences suffering and anxiety:
"How can kings not seize them, how can thieves not steal them, how can fire not burn them, how can water not wash them away, or how can unworthy heirs not seize them?" Even though he protected and guarded his possessions in this way, kings still plundered them, thieves still stole them, fire still burned them, water still swept them away, and unworthy heirs still seized them.
He lamented, grieved, wept, beat his chest, and fainted:
"What was mine, I no longer have."
This, monks, is the danger of desires...
(as above)...
the cause of desires.
17
763
2524
Furthermore, O monks, due to desire as the cause, due to desire as the condition, due to desire as the origin, due to desire itself as the cause, kings contend with kings, Kshatriyas contend with Kshatriyas, Brahmins contend with Brahmins, householders contend with householders, mothers contend with sons, sons contend with mothers, fathers contend with sons, sons contend with fathers, brothers contend with brothers, older brothers contend with older sisters, older sisters contend with older brothers, friends contend with friends.
When they have engaged in disputes, arguments, and conflicts;
they attack each other with their hands;
they attack each other with stones;
they attack each other with sticks;
they attack each other with swords.
Here they come to death, to suffering that is almost death.
"Now, monks, this is the danger of desires...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
18
445
2969
Furthermore, monks, because of desire as the cause...
because of desire itself as the cause, they take up spears and shields, they wear bows and arrows, they line up in two sides, and arrows are aimed at each other, knives are thrown at each other, swords are swung at each other.
They shoot and stab each other with arrows, they throw and stab each other with knives, they decapitate each other with swords.
Here they go to death, to suffering almost like death.
Now, monks, this is the danger of desires...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
19
516
3485
Furthermore, O monks, due to desire as the cause...
due to desire itself as the cause, they take up spears and shields, they wear bows and arrows, they attack newly plastered fortifications, and arrows are aimed at each other, knives are thrown at each other, swords are swung at each other.
Here, they shoot and stab each other with arrows, they throw and stab each other with knives, they pour boiling excrement on each other, they crush each other with stones, they decapitate each other with swords.
Here they go to death, they go to suffering almost like death.
O monks, this is the danger of desires...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
20
1125
1125
Furthermore, O monks, due to desire as the cause...
due to desire itself as the cause, they break into houses, they steal belongings, they act like robbers, they ambush on the main roads, they go to another man's wife.
When kings catch such a person, they apply many different punishments.
They beat with whips, they beat with sticks, they beat with clubs, they chopped off hands, they chopped off feet, they chopped off hands and feet, they cut off ears, they cut off noses, they used the cauldron of boiling oil punishment, they used the crown of the head punishment (cutting off the crown of the head into the shape of a seashell), they used the Rahu mouth punishment...
Fire garland punishment...
Burning hands punishment...
Straw strangulation punishment... 
making clothes from tree bark...
Mountain goat punishment... 
Hooked flesh punishment... 
Coin punishment... 
Cutting flesh into the shape of coins... 
Transformation punishment... 
High platform punishment... 
They poured boiling oil, they fed it to dogs, they impaled living people, they beheaded them with swords.
Here they went to death, to suffering that was almost death.
"Now, monks, this is the danger of desire...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
21
481
1606
Furthermore, monks, because of desire as the cause...
because of desire itself as the cause, they live and commit evil deeds of body, evil deeds of speech, and evil deeds of mind.
Because they live and commit evil deeds of body, evil deeds of speech, and evil deeds of mind, when their body perishes and their life ends, they are reborn in evil realms, evil places, places of suffering, hell.
Now, monks, this is the danger of desire, leading to future suffering, the aggregate of suffering, because of desire as the cause, because of desire as the condition, because of desire as the cause and condition, because of desire itself as the cause.
22
164
1770
Now, monks, what is the liberation from desire?" 
"This, monks, is the taming of sensual desires, the eradication of sensual desires; this is liberation from sensual desires.
23
721
2491
"Monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who do not truly understand the sweetness of sensual desires, the danger of sensual desires, and liberation of sensual desires, will certainly not truly understand their own sensual desires. Nor can they place others in a similar position, that is, truly understand sensual desires; such a thing is impossible." 
"Now, monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who truly understand the sweetness of sensual pleasures, the danger of sensual pleasures, and the liberation of sensual pleasures, will certainly truly understand their own sensual pleasures. They can also place others in a similar position, that is, truly understand sensual pleasures. Such an event does occur."
24
22
2513
(The Sweetness of Material Forms)
25
365
2878
"And now, monks, what is the sweetness of material forms?
"Now, monks, like Kshatriya girls, Brahmin girls, or householder girls, about fifteen or sixteen years old, not too tall, not too short, not too thin, not too fat, not too dark, not too white, monks, do they attain supreme beauty, supreme beauty at that time?" 
26
22
2900
-- Yes, Venerable Lord.
27
104
3004
-- O monks, based on that beautiful form arises pleasure and joy; thus is the sweetness of forms.
28
510
3514
And, O monks, what is the danger of forms?
O monks, here one can see that woman at another time, about eighty, ninety, or one hundred years old, old and weak, bent like a roof, hunched over, needing a cane for support, trembling as she walks, sick, her youth gone, her beard falling out, her hair gray, decaying, bald, her skin wrinkled, her hands and feet withered and gray.
O monks, what do you think?
Has the former beauty of that person now vanished and the danger has appeared?
29
32
3546
-- Venerable Lord, that is the truth.
30
370
3916
-- O monks, this is the danger of material things.
-- Furthermore, O monks, one can see that woman suffering from illness, deeply ill, lying immersed in her own excrement, needing someone to lift her up, needing someone to support her.
O monks, what do you think?
Has the former beauty of that person now vanished and the danger has appeared?
31
32
3948
-- Venerable Lord, that is the truth.
32
361
361
-- O monks, this is the danger of material forms.
Furthermore, O monks, one sees that girl's body thrown into the cemetery, and after one, two, or three days, the body swells up, turns dark green, and rots away.
O monks, what do you think?
Has the former beauty of the girl disappeared, and has the danger become apparent?
33
32
393
-- Yes, Lord, that is true.
34
432
825
-- O monks, this is the danger of material forms.
Furthermore, monks, people see that the girl's body thrown into the cemetery, eaten by crows, or by hawks, or by vultures, or by dogs, or by jackals, or by insects.
What do you think, monks?
Has the former beauty of the girl vanished, and danger has appeared?
35
32
857
-- Yes, Lord.
36
759
1616
-- Monks, this is the danger of material things.
Furthermore, O monks, one sees that girl's body, thrown in the cemetery, with the bones still connected, still clinging to flesh and blood, still bound by tendons...
with the bones still connected, no longer clinging to flesh but still clinging to blood, still bound by tendons, no longer flesh, no blood, still bound by tendons, only bones not joined together, scattered here and there, here are arm bones, here are leg bones, here are shin bones, here are thigh bones, here are buttock bones, here are spine bones, here are skull bones.
O monks, what do you think?
Has the former beauty of the girl now vanished, and danger has appeared?
37
32
1648
-- Yes, Lord, that is true.
38
394
2042
-- O monks, this is the danger of material forms.
-- Furthermore, O monks, people see that girl's body thrown into the cemetery, only white bones the color of snail shells remain...
only a pile of bones for more than a year...
only rotten bones turned to powder.
O monks, what do you think?
Has the former beauty of the girl now vanished, and danger has appeared?
39
32
2074
-- Yes, Lord, that is true.
40
57
2131
-- O monks, this is the danger of material forms.
41
181
2312
O monks, what is the liberation from material forms?
"This, monks, is the subjugation of craving for material things, the eradication of craving; thus, liberation from material things.
42
744
3056
"Monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who do not truly understand the sweetness of material things as such, the danger as such, and liberation as such, will certainly not truly understand their own material things, nor will they be able to place others in a similar position, that is, to truly understand material things; such a thing will not happen." 
"Now, monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who truly understand the sweetness of material things as such, the danger as such, and liberation as such, these certainly truly understand their own material things, and they can also place others in a similar position, that is, truly understand material things; such an event can occur.
43
21
3077
(The Sweetness of Feelings)
44
416
3493
And now, monks, what is the sweetness of feelings?
Here, a monk, having abandoned desires and unwholesome states, attains and abides in the first Jhana, a state of joy and bliss arising from the abandonment of desires, with initial and sustained thought.
At that time, if he does not think of harming himself, does not think of harming others, does not think of harming both, at that time he feels a harmless feeling." 
"Now, monks, that supreme harmlessness, I say, is the sweetness of sensations."
45
633
4126
Furthermore, monks, a monk who has eradicated initial and sustained thought attains and abides in the second jhana, a state of joy and bliss arising from concentration, without initial or sustained thought, with one-pointedness of mind...
A monk who has abandoned joy and abides in equanimity, with mindful awareness, experiences a pleasant sensation in the body which the noble ones call equanimity and bliss, attains and abides in the third jhana... 
A monk who has abandoned pleasure and pain, eradicated the joy and sorrow he had previously experienced, attains and abides in the fourth jhana, without pain or pleasure, with pure equanimity.
At that time, if he does not think of harming himself, does not think of harming others, does not think of harming both, at that time he experiences a harmless sensation.
Now, monks, that supreme harmlessness, I say, is the sweetness of sensations.
46
153
153
And, monks, what is the danger of feelings?
Monks, feelings are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change; thus is the danger of feelings.
47
176
329
And, monks, what is the liberation from feelings?
Monks, the subjugation of craving for feelings, the eradication of craving; thus is called liberation from feelings.
48
737
1066
"O monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who do not truly understand the sweetness of sensations as such, the danger as such, and liberation as such, will certainly not truly understand their own sensations, nor will they be able to place others in a similar position, that is, to truly understand sensations; such an event will not occur.
O monks, those ascetics and Brahmins who truly understand the sweetness of sensations as such, the danger as such, and liberation as such, will certainly truly understand their own sensations; they can place others in a similar position, that is, to truly understand sensations; such an event will occur."
49
83
1149
Thus the Blessed One taught.
Those monks rejoiced and accepted the Buddha's teachings with faith.

13.Ðại kinh Khổ uẩn
3
25
72
(Mahàdukkhakkhanda sutta)
4
17
89
Tôi nghe như vầy:
5
98
187
Một thời, Thế Tôn ở Savatthi, tại Jetavana (Kỳ-đà Lâm), trong vườn ông Anathapindika (Cấp Cô Ðộc).
6
399
586
Lúc ấy nhiều Tỷ-kheo buổi sáng đắp y, cầm y bát, vào thành Savatthi khất thực.
Rồi các Tỷ-kheo ấy suy nghĩ:
"Nay còn quá sớm để đi khất thực ở Savatthi.
Chúng ta hãy đi đến ngôi vườn các Du sĩ ngoại đạo".
Các Tỷ-kheo ấy đi đến ngôi vườn các Du sĩ ngoại đạo, nói lên những lời chúc tụng hỏi thăm xã giao rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Các Du sĩ ngoại đạo ấy nói với các Tỷ-kheo đang ngồi xuống một bên.
7
535
1121
-- Chư Hiền, Sa-môn Gotama nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các dục, chúng tôi cũng nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các dục.
Chư Hiền, Sa-môn Gotama nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các sắc pháp, chúng tôi cũng nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các sắc pháp.
Chư Hiền, Sa-môn Gotama nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các cảm thọ, chúng tôi cũng nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các cảm thọ.
Chư Hiền, ở đây có sự đặc thù nào, sự dị biệt nào, sự sai khác nào giữa Sa-môn Gotama và chúng tôi về vấn đề thuyết pháp hay vấn đề giáo huấn?
8
225
1346
Các Tỷ-kheo ấy không hoan hỷ cũng không chỉ trích những lời nói của các Du sĩ ngoại đạo, không hoan hỷ, không chỉ trích, các Tỷ-kheo từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy, từ biệt với ý nghĩ:
"Chúng ta sẽ học ý nghĩa lời nói này từ Thế Tôn".
9
203
1549
Rồi các Tỷ-kheo ấy, sau khi khất thực ở Savatthi, khi ăn xong và đi khất thực trở về, liền đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, đảnh lễ Ngài và ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, các Tỷ-kheo ấy bạch Thế Tôn:
10
1223
2772
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, ở đây chúng con buổi sáng đắp y, cầm y bát vào thành Savatthi khất thực.
Bạch Thế Tôn, rồi chúng con suy nghĩ:
"Nay còn quá sớm để đi khất thực ở Savatthi.
Chúng ta hãy nghĩ đến ngôi vườn các Du sĩ ngoại đạo".
Bạch Thế Tôn, rồi chúng con đi đến ngôi vườn các Du sĩ ngoại đạo, sau khi đến xong, nói lên những lời chúc tụng hỏi thăm xã giao rồi ngồi xuống một bên, Bạch Thế Tôn, các Du sĩ ngoại đạo ấy nói với chúng con đang ngồi một bên:
"Chư Hiền, Sa-môn Gotama nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các dục, chúng tôi cũng nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các dục.
Chư Hiền, Sa-môn Gotama nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các sắc pháp, chúng tôi cũng nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các sắc pháp.
Chư Hiền, Sa-môn Gotama nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các cảm thọ, chúng tôi cũng nêu rõ sự hiểu biết hoàn toàn về các cảm thọ.
Chư Hiền ở đây có sự đặc thù nào, sự dị biệt nào, sự sai khác nào giữa Sa-môn Gotama và chúng tôi về vấn đề thuyết pháp hay vấn đề giảng huấn?" Bạch Thế Tôn, chúng con không hoan hỷ, không chỉ trích những lời nói của các Du sĩ ngoại đạo.
Không hoan hỷ, không chỉ trích, chúng con từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy, từ biệt với ý nghĩ:
"Chúng ta sẽ học ý nghĩa lời nói này từ Thế Tôn".
11
781
3553
-- Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Du sĩ ngoại đạo nói như vậy cần được trả lời như sau:
"Chư Hiền, thế nào là vị ngọt các dục?
Thế nào là sự nguy hiểm, thế nào là sự xuất ly?
Thế nào là vị ngọt các sắc pháp, thế nào là sự nguy hiểm, thế nào là sự xuất ly?
Thế nào là vị ngọt các cảm thọ, thế nào là sự nguy hiểm, thế nào là sự xuất ly?" Này các Tỷ-kheo, khi được hỏi vậy, các Du sĩ ngoại đạo không thể trả lời được và sẽ bị mắc vào các khó khăn khác.
Vì sao vậy?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, vì vấn đề này không thuộc khả năng hiểu biết của họ.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta không thấy một ai trong thế giới này với chư Thiên, Mara, Phạm thiên, với chúng Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn, với chư Thiên và loài Người, mà câu trả lời các câu hỏi được chấp nhận, trừ Như Lai, đệ tử Như Lai và những ai được nghe hai vị này.
12
17
3570
(Vị ngọt các dục)
13
549
4119
Và này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là vị ngọt các dục?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, có năm pháp tăng trưởng dục này:
Các sắc pháp do nhãn căn nhận thức, khả ái, khả lạc, khả ý, khả hỷ, tương ứng với dục, hấp dẫn, các tiếng do nhĩ căn nhận thức...
các hương do tỷ căn nhận thức...
các vị do thiệt căn nhận thức...
các xúc do thân căn nhận thức, khả ái, khả lạc, khả ý, khả hỷ, tương ứng với dục, hấp dẫn.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, có năm pháp tăng trưởng dục như vậy.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, y cứ vào năm pháp tăng trưởng dục này, có lạc hỷ khởi lên, như vậy là vị ngọt các dục.
14
597
597
Này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là sự nguy hiểm các dục?
Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, có thiện nam tử nuôi sống với nghề nghiệp, như đếm ngón tay, như tính toán, như ước toán, như làm ruộng, như buôn bán, như chăn bò, như bắn cung, như làm công cho vua, như làm một nghề nào khác.
Người ấy phải chống đỡ lạnh, phải chống đỡ nóng, phải chịu đựng sự xúc chạm của ruồi, muỗi, gió, sức nóng, mặt trời, các loài bò sát, bị chết đói chết khát.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục, thiết thực hiện tại, thuộc khổ uẩn, lấy dục làm nhân, lấy dục làm duyên, là nguồn gốc của dục, là nguyên nhân của dục.
15
379
976
Này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu thiện nam tử ấy nỗ lực như vậy, tinh cần như vậy, tinh tấn như vậy, nhưng các tài sản ấy không được đến tay mình, vị ấy than vãn, buồn phiền khóc than, đấm ngực, mê man bất tỉnh:
"Ôi!
Sự nỗ lực của ta thật sự là vô ích, sự tinh cần của ta thật sự không kết quả".
Này các Tỷ-kheo, như vậy, là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
16
785
1761
Này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu thiện nam tử ấy nỗ lực như vậy, tinh cần như vậy, tinh tấn như vậy, và các tài sản ấy được đến tay mình, vì phải hộ trì các tài sản ấy, vị ấy cảm thọ sự đau khổ, ưu tư:
"Làm sao các vua chúa khỏi cướp đoạt chúng, làm sao trộm cướp khỏi cướp đoạt chúng, làm sao lửa khỏi đốt cháy, nước khỏi cuốn trôi, hay các kẻ thừa tự không xứng đáng khỏi cướp đoạt chúng?" Dầu vị ấy hộ trì như vậy, giữ gìn như vậy, vua chúa vẫn cướp đoạt các tài sản ấy, trộm cướp vẫn cướp đoạt, lửa vẫn đốt cháy, nước vẫn cuốn trôi hay các kẻ thừa tự không xứng đáng vẫn cướp đoạt chúng.
Vị ấy than vãn, buồn phiền, khóc than, đấm ngực, mê man bất tỉnh:
"Cái đã thuộc của ta, nay ta không có nữa".
Này các Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
17
763
