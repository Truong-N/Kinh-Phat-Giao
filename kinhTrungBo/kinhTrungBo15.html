Venerable monks, let's say a young woman or man, in her youth, who loves makeup, examines her face in a clean, transparent glass, or in a bowl of clear water.
If he sees dust or dirt on his face, he diligently removes that dust or dirt.
If he sees no dust or dirt on his face, he will happily think:
"Truly I have received good things;
I am truly pure."
Likewise, Venerable Monks, if while observing, a Bhikkhu clearly sees that all evil and unwholesome dharmas have not been eliminated within his mind, then Venerable Monks and Monks need to be diligent in eliminating those evil and unwholesome dharmas.
