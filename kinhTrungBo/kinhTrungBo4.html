At one time the World-Honored One was at Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika (Anathapindika).
Then Brahmin Janussoni went to the place where the Blessed One was staying. When he arrived, he said words of welcome and greetings to the Blessed One, after saying words of welcome and friendly greetings, he sat down to one side.
Sitting down to one side, Brahmin Janussoni said to the World-Honored One:
6
356
785
-- Venerable Gotama, there are good men who, because of their faith in Venerable Gotama, have left home, left home, and lived without a family.
For these people, Venerable Gotama is the leader.
For these people, Venerable Gotama is very helpful.
For these people, the Venerable Gotama is an encourager of books.
These people agreed to follow Venerable Gotama's views.
7
324
1109
-- Hey Brahmin, it's really like that.
This Brahman, it is true.
Brahmin, there are good men who, because of their faith in me, have left home, abandoned their families, and lived without families.
I am their leader.
I have been of great help to them.
I am the one who encourages them to advance.
And these people agree to follow My point of view.
8
234
1343
-- Venerable Gotama, how difficult it is to endure remote residences in desolate forests and mountains!
How difficult is life in separation!
How difficult it is to enjoy solitary life!
I think that the mountains and forests confuse the mind of a monk who has not attained Zen.
9
297

-- Hey Brahmin, it's really like that.
This Brahman, it is true.
Brahmin, how difficult it is to endure remote residences in desolate forests and mountains!
It's difficult, a life of separation!
How difficult it is to enjoy solitary life!
I think that the mountains and forests confuse the mind of a monk who has not attained Zen.
10
317

Brahmin, in the past, when I had not yet realized enlightenment, when I was still a Bodhisattva, I thought as follows:
"It is difficult to be patient in remote places, in desolate forests and mountains!
It's difficult, a life of separation!
How difficult it is to enjoy solitary life!
I think that the mountains and forests confuse the mind of a monk who has not attained Zen!"
11

"During the known and determined nights, the fourteenth night, the fifteenth night, the eighth night of every fortnight, on such nights, let us go and stay in places of fear, hair standing on end, such as temples in the gardens, temples in the forests and mountains, temples in the trees, so that I can see that fear and terror."
Brahmin, after a period of time, on the known and determined nights, the fourteenth night, the fifteenth night, the eighth night of each month, on such nights, I came to stay in such terrible places, with hair standing on end, such as temples in the gardens, temples in the forests and mountains, temples in the trees.
Brahmin, while I am in those places, an animal may come, or a peacock may drop a branch, or the wind may shake the fallen leaves;
I started thinking:
"Now that terrible fear has come!".
Hey Brahmin, then I thought:
"Why am I here, expecting only fear and nothing else?
In any of My acts and gestures that fear and terror come, in that act and gesture, Let me eliminate that fear and terror.
26
828
1944

27
742
2686
Brahmin, there are some recluses and brahmins who think that day is like night, think that night is like day.
Thus, I say that those Samanas and Brahmins live in ignorance.
Brahmin, I think that night is night, I think that day is day.
Brahmin, whoever speaks truthfully will say the following:
"Any sentient being without delusion is born into this world for the happiness of all beings, for the peace of all beings, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, for the happiness, for the peace of Gods and humans.
When he speaks truthfully about me, he will say the following:
"A sentient being without delusion, born into this world for the happiness of all beings, for the peace of all beings, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, for the happiness, for the peace of Gods and humans."
28
165
2851
Hey Brahmin, I am diligent, diligent, not lazy.
We stay mindful, there is no chaos, the body is calm, there are no fluctuations, the mind is calm and focused.
29
124
2975
Brahmin, I am separated from desire, separated from evil dharmas, attaining and staying in the first Meditation, a state of joy and happiness born of separation from desire, with the reach of the four thoughts.
30
125
3100
Ceasing thoughts and thoughts, I attain and dwell in the second Meditation, a state of joy and happiness born of concentration, without thoughts, without thoughts, with a single mind.
31
129
3229
Letting go of joy and staying in equanimity, being mindful and alert, and feeling the blissful feeling that the Saints call the dwelling of equanimity and happiness, I attain and abide in the Third Meditation.
32
120
3349
Letting go of happiness and suffering, eliminating the joy and sorrow we felt before, we attain and abide in the Fourth Meditation, neither suffering nor happiness, letting go of pure thoughts.
33
954
954
With a mind that is calm, pure, untainted, free of afflictions, flexible, easy to use, steady, and calm, I guide and direct the mind to the wisdom of life.
We remember past lives, such as one life, two lives, three lives, four lives, five lives, ten lives, twenty lives, thirty lives, forty lives, fifty lives, one hundred lives, two hundred lives, one thousand lives, one hundred thousand lives, many decaying lives, many forming lives, many decaying and forming lives.
We remember that:
"In that place, I have such a name, such a family name, such a class, such foods, such sufferings and pleasures, and such a long lifespan.
After dying in that place, I was born in this place.
In this place, I have such a name, such a family name, such a class, such foods, such sufferings and pleasures, and such a long lifespan.
After dying in this place, I was born here."
Thus I remember many past lives along with their outlines and details.
34
174
1128
Brahmin, in the first watch of the night I realized the first proof: ignorance is destroyed, clarity is born;
Darkness disappears, light arises, while I live without distraction, with enthusiasm and diligence.
35
1167
2295
With a mind that is calm, pure, untainted, free of afflictions, pliable, easy to use, solid, and calm, I guide and direct my mind to the knowledge of birth and death about sentient beings.
I, with pure supernatural eyes, see the life and death of living beings.
I understand that sentient beings, lowly, noble, beautiful, ugly, lucky, unfortunate, all depend on their karma.
Sentient beings do evil deeds of body, evil deeds of speech, evil deeds of mind, slander the Saints, follow wrong views, create karma according to wrong views.
These people, after the body breaks up and die, must be reborn in the evil realm, the evil realm, the lower realms, and hell.
As for those beings who achieve good deeds of body, achieve good deeds of speech, achieve good deeds of mind, do not slander the Saints, follow the right view, create karma according to the right view, these people, after the body breaks up and die, will be born in good destinations, the Heavens, in this world.
Thus, with pure superhuman eyes, I see the life and death of living beings.
I understand that living beings, lowly people, noble people, beautiful people, rough people, ugly people, lucky people, unfortunate people, all depend on their karma.
36
175
2470
Brahmin, in the middle of the night watch, I realized the second proof, ignorance is destroyed, clarity is born;
Darkness disappears, light arises, while I live without distraction, with enthusiasm and diligence.
37
563
3033
With a mind that is calm, pure, untainted, free from afflictions, flexible, easy to use, solid, and calm, I guide and direct the mind to the defilements of wisdom.
I know as it really is:
"This is suffering", directly knowing as it really is:
"This is the cause of suffering", directly knowing as it really is:
"This is the cessation of suffering", directly knowing as it really is:
"This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering", directly knowing as it really is:
"These are defilements", directly knowing as they really are:
"This is the cause of the defilements", directly knowing as it really is:
"These are the cesspools or cessation", directly knowing as they really are:
"This is the path leading to the destruction of all defilements."
38
306
3339
Thanks to knowing like that, thanks to seeing like that, my mind is freed from the canker of desire, freed from the canker of being, freed from the canker of ignorance.
For such a liberated self, understanding arises:
I have been liberated.
I have learned:
"Birth has ended, the holy life has been achieved, what needed to be done has been done, there is no more returning to this state."
39
171
3510
Brahmin, in the third watch of the night, I realized the third proof, the destruction of ignorance, the birth of clarity;
Darkness disappears, light arises, while I live without distraction, with enthusiasm and diligence.
40
389
3899
Brahmin, you may have the following thoughts:
"Now the monk Gotama has not eliminated greed, has not eliminated anger, has not eliminated ignorance, so he lives in remote places, in desolate forests and mountains."
Hey Brahmin, don't understand it like that.
Because I observed two purposes, I lived in remote places, in desolate forests and mountains.
See for yourself the present happiness and out of compassion for sentient beings in the future.
41
624
624
-- The sentient beings of the future are sympathized with by the Venerable Gotama, because the Venerable is an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One.
How wonderful, Venerable Gotama!
How wonderful, Venerable Gotama!...
Like someone who straightens up what has been thrown down, exposes what is hidden, shows the way to those who are lost, brings a light into the darkness so that those with eyes can see clearly.
Likewise, the Dharma was presented and explained by Venerable Gotama using many means.
I take refuge in Venerable Gotama, take refuge in the Dharma and take refuge in the Bhikkhu Sangha.
I hope Venerable Gotama will accept me as his disciple;
From now on until I die, I will live forever.

Một thời Thế Tôn ở Savatthi (Xá-vệ), tại Jetavana (Kỳ-đà Lâm), vườn ông Anathapindika (Cấp Cô Ðộc).
Rồi Bà-la-môn Janussoni đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, khi đến xong, nói lên những lời chào đón hỏi thăm với Thế Tôn, sau khi nói lên những lời chào đón hỏi thăm thân hữu, rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Ngồi xuống một bên, Bà-la-môn Janussoni bạch Thế Tôn:
6
356
785
-- Tôn giả Gotama, có những Thiện nam tử, vì lòng tin Tôn giả Gotama, đã xuất gia, từ bỏ gia đình, sống không gia đình.
Ðối với những vị này, Tôn giả Gotama là vị lãnh đạo.
Ðối với những vị này, Tôn giả Gotama giúp ích rất nhiều.
Ðối với những vị này, Tôn giả Gotama là vị khích lệ sách tấn.
Các vị này chấp nhận tuân theo quan điểm của Tôn giả Gotama.
7
324
1109
-- Này Bà-la-môn, thật sự là vậy.
Này Bà-la-môn, thật sự là vậy.
Này Bà-la-môn, có những Thiện nam tử, vì lòng tin nơi Ta, đã xuất gia, từ bỏ gia đình, sống không gia đình.
Ta là vị lãnh đạo của họ.
Ta đã giúp ích rất nhiều cho họ.
Ta là vị khích lệ sách tấn cho họ.
Và các vị này chấp nhận tuân theo quan điểm của Ta.
8
234
1343
-- Tôn giả Gotama, thật khó kham nhẫn những trú xứ xa vắng trong rừng núi hoang vu!
Thật khó khăn đời sống viễn ly!
Thật khó thưởng thức đời sống độc cư!
Con nghĩ rằng rừng núi làm rối loạn tâm trí vị Tỷ-kheo chưa chứng Thiền định.
9
297
1640
-- Này Bà-la-môn, thật sự là vậy.
Này Bà-la-môn, thật sự là vậy.
Này Bà-la-môn, thật khó kham nhẫn những trú xứ xa vắng trong rừng núi hoang vu!
Thật khó khăn, đời sống viễn ly!
Thật khó thưởng thức đời sống độc cư!
Ta nghĩ rằng rừng núi làm rối loạn tâm trí vị Tỷ-kheo chưa chứng Thiền định.
10
317
1957
Này Bà-la-môn, xưa kia khi Ta chưa chứng ngộ chánh đẳng giác, khi còn là Bồ-tát, Ta nghĩ như sau:
"Thật khó kham nhẫn những trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu!
Thật khó khăn, đời sống viễn ly!
Thật khó thưởng thức đời sống độc cư!
Ta nghĩ rằng rừng núi làm rối loạn tâm trí vị Tỷ-kheo chưa chứng Thiền định!"
11
682
2639
Này Bà-la-môn, rồi Ta suy nghĩ:
"Những Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn nào, thân nghiệp không thanh tịnh, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu, do nguyên nhân nhiễm trước, thân nghiệp không thanh tịnh, những Tôn giả Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn ấy chắc chắn làm cho sợ hãi, khiếp đảm, bất thiện khởi lên.
Ta không có thân nghiệp không thanh tịnh, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu.
Thân nghiệp Ta thanh tịnh.
Ta là một trong những bậc Thánh, với thân nghiệp thanh tịnh, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu".
Này Bà-la-môn, Ta tự quán sát thân nghiệp hoàn toàn thanh tịnh này, tự cảm thấy lòng tự tin được xác chứng hơn, khi sống trong rừng núi.
12
797
3436
Này Bà-la-môn, tùy thuộc vấn đề này, Ta suy nghĩ như sau:
"Những Sa-môn, hay Bà-la-môn nào, có khẩu nghiệp không thanh tịnh...
(như trên)...
có ý nghiệp không thanh tịnh...
(như trên)...
có mạng sống không thanh tịnh sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu, do nguyên nhân nhiễm trước mạng sống không thanh tịnh, những Tôn giả Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn ấy chắc chắn làm cho sợ hãi, khiếp đảm, bất thiện khởi lên.
Ta không có mạng sống không thanh tịnh, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu.
Mạng sống Ta thanh tịnh.
Ta là một trong những bậc Thánh, với mạng sống thanh tịnh, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu".
Này Bà-la-môn, Ta tự quán sát mạng sống hoàn toàn thanh tịnh này, tự cảm thấy lòng tự tin được xác chứng hơn, khi sống trong rừng núi.
13
685
4121
Này Bà-la-môn, tùy thuộc vấn đề này, Ta suy nghĩ như sau:
"Những Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn nào tham dục, có ái dục cường liệt, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu, do nguyên nhân nhiễm trước tham dục, có ái dục cường liệt, những Tôn giả Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn ấy chắc chắn làm cho sợ hãi, khiếp đảm, bất thiện khởi lên.
Ta không có tham dục, ái dục cường liệt, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng trong rừng núi hoang vu.
Ta không có tham dục, Ta là một trong những bậc Thánh, không có tham dục, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu".
Này Bà-la-môn, Ta tự quán sát Ta không có tham dục như vậy, tự cảm thấy lòng tự tin được xác chứng hơn, khi sống trong rừng núi.
14
630
630
Này Bà-la-môn, tùy thuộc vấn đề này, Ta suy nghĩ như sau:
"Những Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn nào có tâm sân hận ác ý, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng, trong rừng núi hoang vu, do nguyên nhân nhiễm trước, có tâm sân hận ác ý, những Tôn giả Sa-môn hay Bà-la-môn ấy chắc chắn làm cho sợ hãi, khiếp đảm, bất thiện khởi lên.
Ta không có tâm sân hận, ác ý, sống tại các trú xứ xa vắng trong rừng núi hoang vu.
Ta có từ tâm.

Mong Tôn giả Gotama nhận con làm đệ tử;
từ này trở đi cho đến mạng chung, con trọn đời quy ngưỡng.
