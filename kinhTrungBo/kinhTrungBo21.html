Thus I heard.

At one time, the World-Honored One was at Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika (Anathapindika).
6
498
685
At that time, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in excessive contact with the Bhikkhunis.
Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in connection with the Bhikkhunis as follows:
If any Bhikkhu spoke ill of those Bhikkhunis in front of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna would immediately be indignant, dissatisfied, and question the matter immediately;
If any Bhikkhus, in front of those Bhikkhunis, speak ill of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, those Bhikkhunis will immediately be angry, dissatisfied, and immediately question the matter.
The Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in contact with the Bhikkhunis like that.
7
147
832
There was another monk who went to the place where the World-Honored One lived. After arriving, he bowed to the World-Honored One and sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, the monk told the World-Honored One:
8
550
1382
-- World-Honored One, Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in excessive contact with the Bhikkhunis.
World-Honored One, Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in connection with the Bhikkhunis as follows:
If any Bhikkhu spoke ill of those Bhikkhunis in front of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna would immediately be indignant, dissatisfied and immediately question the matter;
If any Bhikkhus, in front of those Bhikkhunis, speak ill of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, those Bhikkhunis will immediately be indignant, dissatisfied and immediately question the matter.
World-Honored One, Venerable Moliya Phagguna lives in such an excessive way with the Bhikkhunis.
9
36
1418
The World-Honored One called another monk and said:
10
117
1535
-- Hey monk, go, in my name, summon the monk Moliya Phagguna:
"Sage Phagguna, the Teacher calls you Sage".
11
22
1557
-- World-Honored One, yes!
12
113
1670
The bhiksu answered the Blessed One and went to Venerable Moliya Phagguna. When he arrived, he immediately said to Venerable Moliya Phagguna:
13
53
1723
-- Sage Moliya Phagguna, the Teacher calls him Sage.
14
18
1741
-- Yes, Sage.
15
183
1924
Bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna answered yes. Bhikkhu went to the place where the Blessed One was staying. When he arrived, he bowed to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.
The Blessed One said to Venerable Moliya Phagguna who was sitting to one side:
16
460
2384
-- Hey Phagguna, is it true that what people say is that you live in excessive contact with Bhikkhunis?
It is rumored that he lived in association with the Bhikkhunis as follows:
"If any Bhikkhu spoke ill of those Bhikkhunis in front of him, he would immediately be indignant, dissatisfied, and immediately question them;
If any Bhikkhu, in front of those Bhikkhunis, speaks ill of you, those Bhikkhunis will immediately be indignant, dissatisfied, and immediately question you."
Hey Phagguna, do you live in such contact with Bhikkhunis?
17
28
2412
-- World-Honored One, it is so.
18
107
2519
-- Hey Phagguna, are you a good man who, because of his faith, left home and left home to live without a family?
19
27
2546
-- Yes, Venerable One.
20
607
3153
-- Phagguna, it is not worthy for you, a good man, to become a monk because of your faith, to leave home, to live without a family, and to live in such an excessive way in association with Bhikkhunis.
Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone in your presence speaks ill of those Bhikkhunis, Phagguna, you must give up desires related to the world, thoughts related to the world.
Hey Phagguna, you must study as follows:
"I hope my heart will not be affected by sadness!
I hope I won't say bad words!
I hope that I will live with compassion, with compassion, without holding anger!" Hey Phagguna, you have to study like that.
21
844
3997
Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone in front of you hits those Bhikkhunis with their hands, throws them with dirt, hits them with a stick, hits them with a sword, Phagguna, you must give up these desires...
do not hold anger.
Hey Phagguna, you have to study like that.
Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone speaks ill of (someone) in front of you, Phagguna, you must give up desires...
do not hold anger.
Hey Phagguna, you have to study like that.
Therefore, Phagguna, if there is anyone in front of you who hits you with your hands, throws dirt, hits you with a stick, or hits you with a sword, Phagguna, you must give up desires related to the world, thoughts related to the world.
Hey Phagguna, you must study as follows:
"I hope my mind will not be corrupted!
I hope I won't say bad words!
I hope that I will live with compassion, with compassion, without holding anger!" Hey Phagguna, you have to study like that.
22
32
4029
Then the World-Honored One said to the monks:
23
1126
1126
-- Monks, at one time my monks had very mature hearts of joy.
Here, monks, I tell you, monks, I follow the practice of one sitting and eating.
Monks, living according to the practice of one sitting and eating, I feel no illness, no sickness, light, healthy and refreshing.
Monks, you should live according to the practice of one sitting and eating.
Bhikkhus, if you follow the practice of one sitting, you will feel free of illness, disease, light, healthy and refreshed.
Monks, I do not need to teach anything to those monks;
Monks, I just need to arouse memories in those Monks.
Monks, for example, on flat land, at an intersection, there is a car parked, braked with a good horse, with a horse whip placed horizontally at the ready.
There is a skillful horse magician, a charioteer who controls the horses that deserve to be controlled, climbs into that carriage, holds the reins in his left hand, holds the whip in his right hand, and can drive that chariot back and forth, wherever and how he wants.
Likewise, monks, I do not need to teach anything to those monks;
Monks, I just need to arouse memories in those Monks.
24

Therefore, monks, abandon unwholesome things and make efforts towards wholesome dharmas, only then will you achieve maturity, prosperity, and growth in this Dharma and Law.
Monks, as well as near a village or small town, there is a large forest of tala trees, the forest is covered with ylang-ylang vines.
There was a person who came to this forest, wanting to benefit the forest, wanting happiness, wanting peace from the yoke of the forest.
He cut off the bent tree branches that lacked vitality, threw them out of the forest, and cleaned up the forest.
He carefully takes care of the straight, well-grown branches of the tala tree.
Monks, after a while, such a forest matures, flourishes, and grows strong.
In the same way, monks, you should abandon unwholesome things and make efforts towards wholesome dharmas. Only then will you achieve maturity, prosperity, and growth in this Dharma and Law.

2805
Monks, once upon a time, in the city of Savatthi, there was a female householder named Vedehika.
Monks, the following good rumor has arisen about the female householder Vedehika:
"The female head of the house Vedehika is gentle, the female head of the house Vedehika is gentle;
Female homeowner Vedehika is peaceful".
Monks, the female householder Vedehika has a maid named Kali, who is skillful, diligent, and works carefully and thoroughly.
Monks, the maidservant Kali had the thought:
"My master has received a good rumor as follows:
"The female head of the house Vedehika is gentle;
Female homeowner Vedehika is docile;
Female homeowner Vedehika is peaceful".
I don't know if my female mistress has an inner anger but doesn't reveal it or doesn't have an inner anger, or because I do the work carefully and thoroughly, my female mistress has an inner anger but doesn't reveal it, it's not like she doesn't have it.
Then let me try my mistress!"
26
109
2914
Monks, the maid Kali got up very late the next morning.
Monks, the female householder Vedehika said to the maid Kali:
27
12
2926
-- Hey Kali!
28
27
2953
-- Dear Mistress, what's the matter?
29
33
2986
-- Why are you up so late today?
30
31
3017
-- Dear lady, what's the matter?
31
69
3086
-- Is there really nothing to do?
Evil maid, you woke up late today!"
32
38
3124
And the female owner was angry, dissatisfied, and glared.
33
268
3392
Bhikkhus, the maid Kali pondered:
"My mistress really has an inner court but she doesn't show it, it's not like she doesn't have it.
Because the work I do is done carefully and thoroughly, even though my female boss has an inner court, she doesn't show it, it's not like she doesn't have it.
Then let me try again my mistress!"
34
107
3499
Monks, the maid Kali woke up even later the next day.
Monks, the mistress Vedehika said to the maid Kali:
35
12
3511
-- Hey Kali!
36
27
3538
-- Dear Mistress, what's the matter?
37
33
3571
-- Why are you up so late today?
38
31
3602
-- Dear Mistress, what's the matter?
39
68
3670
-- Is there really nothing to do?
Evil maid, you woke up late today!
40
55
3725
And the female owner was indignant, dissatisfied, and uttered words of dissatisfaction.
41
267
3992
Bhikkhus, the maid Kali pondered:
"My mistress really has an inner court but she doesn't show it, it's not like she doesn't have it.
Because I do the work carefully and thoroughly, even though my mistress has an inner court, she doesn't show it, it's not like she doesn't have it.
Then let me try again my mistress!"
42
111
4103
Monks, the maid Kali got up even later the next morning.
Monks, the mistress Vedehika said to the maid Kali:
43
12
4115
-- Hey Kali!
44
27
4142
-- Dear Mistress, what's the matter?
45
33
4175
-- Why are you up so late today?
46
31
31
-- Dear Mistress, what's the matter?
47
68
99
-- Is there really nothing to do?
Evil maid, you woke up late today!
48
95
194
Then, angry and not happy, she picked up the door latch and hit the maid on the head, breaking it.
49
83
277
The monks, the maid Kali, with blood flowing from her head, immediately went and told the neighbors:
50
265
542
-- Look at the work of the gentle mistress!
Look at the work of the obedient female owner!
Look at the work of the peaceful female boss!
Why did the mistress say to the only maid:
"You got up late today", then angry and dissatisfied, she grabbed the door latch and hit me on the head, causing my head to break.
51
188
730
Monks, after a while, the following bad rumor arose about the mistress Vedehika:
"Mistress Vedehika is cruel!
The female lead Vedehika is not submissive!
Mistress Vedehika is not gentle!"
52
1050
1780
Likewise, Bhikkhus, here, Bhikkhus are extremely gentle, extremely docile, and extremely peaceful while not being subjected to unpleasant or insulting words.
And monks, only when a monk is subjected to unpleasant and insulting words but he is still very gentle, very docile, and very peaceful, then can he be considered gentle, can he be considered docile, can he be considered peaceful.
Bhikkhus, I do not call a Bhikkhu easy to talk about, when he easily talks about things such as robes, food, seating, medicine to treat illness, when he achieves the nature of easy to talk.
Why is that?
Monks, when a monk does not have things such as clothes, food, a bed, medicine to treat illness, he is no longer easy to speak of, no longer achieves the nature of ease of speaking.
Monks, any monk who respects the Dharma, respects the Dharma, reveres the Dharma, becomes easy to speak, achieves the nature of being easy to speak, is the one I call easy to speak.
Therefore, monks, think:
"Just because we respect the Dharma, revere the Dharma, and revere the Dharma, we will become easy to speak, achieve the nature of being easy to speak."
Monks, you must study like that.
53
1188
2968
Monks, there are five types of language that you can use when speaking to others:
timely or untimely, real or not real, soft or rough, beneficial or not beneficial, with a loving mind or with an angry mind.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak at the right time or at the wrong time.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak truthful words or untrue words.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak soft words or harsh words.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can say beneficial words or unprofitable words.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak with a loving mind or with an angry mind.
Monks, here, you need to study as follows:
"We will keep our minds untainted, we will not utter evil words, we will live with compassion, with compassion, with no anger in our hearts.
We will live surrounding this person with a mind that is accompanied by kindness.
And with this person as the object, I live abundantly throughout the world with a mind united with kindness, boundless, without hatred, without anger.
Monks, so you need to study.
54
413
3381
Monks, suppose a person comes, holding a shovel and basket, and says as follows:
"I will make this great land no longer soil", and that person digs here and there, spreads soil here and there, spits here and there, urinates here and there, with the thought:
"You become not the land, You become not the land".
Monks, what do you think?
Can he make this great land become no land?
55
182
3563
-- World-Honored One, no.
Why is that?
Because this great earth is profound and immeasurable, it is not easy for this great earth to become non-earth before one becomes tired and defeated.
56
715
715
-- Likewise, monks, there are five types of language that you can speak to others:
"Timely or untimely...
or with anger".
Monks, when speaking to others, you can say:
"The time is right...
or with anger".
Monks, here, you need to study as follows:
"We will keep our minds untainted;
we will not utter evil words;
We will live with compassion, with compassion, and without anger;
We will live contentedly with this person with a mind that is accompanied by kindness.
And with this person as the object, I live abundantly throughout the world, with a mind that is accompanied by kindness, generous, boundless, without hatred, without anger.
Monks, you need to study like that.
57
332
1047
Monks, let's say a person comes, holding paint, yellow, dark blue or purple;
he or she might say the following:
"I will write forms in this void.
I will make forms appear."
Monks, what do you think?
Can he write forms in space and make them appear?
58
214
1261
-- World-Honored One, it is impossible.
Why is that?
World-Honored One, nothingness is formless and cannot be seen.
Here, it is not easy to write the forms and make them appear, before one gets tired and fails.
59
334
1595
-- Likewise, monks, there are five types of language that you can speak to others:
"Timely or untimely...
or with anger...
(as above)...
And with this person as the object, I live abundantly throughout the world with a mind that is united with kindness, generous, boundless, without hatred, without anger.
Monks, you need to study like that.
60
269
1864
Monks, suppose a person comes holding a bundle of burning dry grass and says as follows:
"I and this bundle of burning dry grass will heat and boil this Ganges River.
Monks, what do you think?
Can that person, with burning dry grass, heat and boil the Ganges River?
61
210
2074
-- World-Honored One, no.
Why is that?
World-Honored One, because the Ganges River is deep and immeasurable, it is not easy for a person to warm up and boil the Ganges River with a bunch of burning dry grass, before he gets tired and fails.
62
438
2512
-- Likewise, monks, there are five types of language that you can speak to others:
"Timely or untimely...
or with anger".
Monks, when speaking to others, you can say:
"The time is right...
or with anger...
(as above)...
And with this person as the object, I live abundantly throughout the world with a mind that is united with kindness, generous, boundless, without hatred, without anger.
Monks, you need to study like that.
63
684
3196
-- Monks, it is like a bag made of cat skin, which has been tanned, well-tanned, well-tanned everywhere, soft, like cotton, with no hissing or squishy sounds, and a person comes holding a stick or a pot of clay and says as follows:
"I will use a stick or a batch of clay to make this bag of cat skin, which is well-tanned, well-tanned, well-tanned all over, soft, like cotton, no more squeaking, squeaking sounds, making squeaking, squeaking sounds."
Monks, what do you think?
Can that person, with a stick or a clay pot, make this catskin bag that is well-tanned, well-tanned, well-tanned all over, soft, like cotton, without any hissing or squishing sounds?
64
293
3489
-- World-Honored One, no.
Why is that?
World-Honored One, this bag made of cat skin has been tanned, well-tanned, well-tanned everywhere, soft, like cotton, with no more hissing or sagging sounds. It is not easy to make that bag make squeaking or squishing sounds before that person gets tired and fails.
65
1188
1188
-- Likewise, monks, there are five types of language that you can use when speaking to others:
"At the right time or not at the right time, real or not real, soft or rough, beneficial or not beneficial, with kindness or with anger."
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak at the right time or at the wrong time.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak truthful words or untrue words.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak soft words or harsh words.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can say beneficial words or unprofitable words.
Monks, when speaking to others, you can speak with a loving mind or with an angry mind.
Monks, here, you need to study as follows:
"We will keep our minds untainted, we will not utter evil words;
We will live with compassion, with compassion, and without anger.
We will live contentedly with this person with a mind that is compatible with kindness.
And with this person as the object, I live abundantly throughout the world with a mind that is united with kindness, generous, boundless, without hatred, without anger." Monks, you need to study like that.
66
661
1849
Monks, like low-class thieves, use a double-edged saw to saw hands and feet;
However, if anyone here becomes confused, he is therefore not a practitioner of My teachings.
Here, you monks must study as follows:
"We will keep our minds untainted;
we will not utter evil words;
We will live with compassion, with compassion, and without anger.
We will live surrounding this person with a mind that is accompanied by kindness.
And with this person as the object, I live abundantly throughout the world with a mind that is united with kindness, generous, boundless, without hatred, without anger.
Monks, you need to study like that.
67
193
2042
And monks, if you always reflect on this saw-like teaching, then monks, do you see any kind of language, whether delicate or harsh, that you cannot endure?
68
23
2065
-- World-Honored One, no.
69
118
2183
-- Monks, therefore, always reflect on this saw-like teaching, and you will be happy and peaceful for a long time.
70
79
2262
The World-Honored One preached like that.
Those monks were happy and believed in the Buddha's teachings.

Một thời, Thế Tôn ở Savatthi (Xá-vệ), tại Jetavana (Kỳ-đà Lâm), vườn ông Anathapindika (Cấp Cô Ðộc).
6

685
Lúc bấy giờ, Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo ni một cách quá độ.
Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni như sau:
Nếu có Tỷ-kheo nào, trước mặt Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna nói xấu các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy, Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna liền phẫn nộ, bất mãn, vấn tội ngay;
nếu có Tỷ-kheo nào, trước mặt các Tỷ-kheo ni ấy, nói xấu Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna, các Tỷ-kheo ni ấy liền phẫn nộ, bất mãn, vấn tội ngay.
Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni như vậy.
7
147
832
Có một Tỷ-kheo khác đi đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, sau khi đến, đảnh lễ Thế Tôn và ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, Tỷ-kheo ấy bạch Thế Tôn:
8
550
1382
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo ni một cách quá độ.
Bạch Thế Tôn, Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni như sau:
Nếu có Tỷ-kheo nào, trước mặt Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna nói xấu các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy, Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna liền phẫn nộ, bất mãn và vấn tội ngay;
nếu có Tỷ-kheo nào, trước mặt các Tỷ-kheo ni ấy, nói xấu Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna, các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy liền phẫn nộ, bất mãn và vấn tội ngay.
Bạch Thế Tôn, Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni một cách quá độ như vậy.
9
36
1418
Thế Tôn gọi một Tỷ-kheo khác và bảo:
10
117
1535
-- Này Tỷ-kheo, hãy đi, nhân danh Ta, cho gọi Tỷ-kheo Moliya Phagguna:
"Hiền giả Phagguna, bậc Ðạo Sư gọi Hiền giả".
11
22
1557
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, vâng!
12
113
1670
Tỷ-kheo ấy vâng đáp Thế Tôn, đi đến chỗ Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna, khi đến xong, liền thưa Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna:
13
53
1723
-- Hiền giả Moliya Phagguna, bậc Ðạo Sư gọi Hiền giả.
14
18
1741
-- Vâng, Hiền giả.
15
183
1924
Tỷ-kheo Moliya Phagguna vâng đáp Tỷ-kheo ấy, đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, khi đến xong, đảnh lễ Thế Tôn rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Thế Tôn nói với Tôn giả Moliya Phagguna đang ngồi xuống một bên:
16
460
2384
-- Này Phagguna, có đúng sự thật không, như lời người ta đồn là Ông sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni một cách quá độ.
Người ta đồn Ông sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni như sau:
"Nếu Tỷ-kheo nào, trước mặt Ông nói xấu các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy, Ông liền phẫn nộ, bất mãn, vấn tội ngay;
nếu Tỷ-kheo nào, trước mặt các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy, nói xấu Ông, các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy liền phẫn nộ, bất mãn, vấn tội ngay".
Này Phagguna, có phải Ông sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni như vậy?
17
28
2412
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có như vậy.
18
107
2519
-- Này Phagguna, có phải Ông là Thiện nam tử, vì lòng tin, đã xuất gia từ bỏ gia đình, sống không gia đình?
19
27
2546
-- Thưa vâng, bạch Thế Tôn.
20
607
3153
-- Này Phagguna, thật không xứng đáng cho Ông, một Thiện nam tử, vì lòng tin đã xuất gia, từ bỏ gia đình, sống không gia đình, mà sống liên hệ với các Tỷ-kheo-ni một cách quá độ như vậy.
Do vậy, này Phagguna, nếu có ai trước mặt Ông, nói xấu các Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy, này Phagguna, Ông phải từ bỏ những dục liên hệ đến thế tục, những tư duy liên hệ đến thế tục.
Này Phagguna, Ông phải học tập như sau:
"Mong rằng tâm của ta sẽ không bi biến nhiễm!
Mong rằng ta sẽ không nói những lời ác ngữ!
Mong rằng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, không ôm lòng sân hận!" Này Phagguna, Ông phải học tập như vậy.
21
844
3997
Do vậy, này Phagguna, nếu có ai trước mặt Ông, lấy tay đánh những Tỷ-kheo-ni ấy, lấy đất ném, lấy gậy đập, lấy gươm đánh, này Phagguna, Ông phải từ bỏ những dục...
không ôm lòng sân hận.
Này Phagguna, Ông phải học tập như vậy.
Do vậy, này Phagguna, nếu có ai trước mặt Ông nói xấu (ai), này Phagguna, Ông phải từ bỏ những dục...
không ôm lòng sân hận.
Này Phagguna, Ông phải học tập như vậy.
Do vậy, này Phagguna, nếu có ai trước mặt Ông lấy tay đánh, lấy đất ném, lấy gậy đập, lấy gươm đánh, này Phagguna, Ông phải từ bỏ những dục liên hệ đến thế tục, những tư duy liên hệ đến thế tục.
Này Phagguna, Ông phải học tập như sau:
"Mong rằng tâm của ta sẽ không bị biến nhiễm!
Mong rằng ta sẽ không nói những lời ác ngữ!
Mong rằng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, không ôm lòng sân hận!" Này Phagguna, Ông phải học tập như vậy.

Rồi Thế Tôn nói với các Tỷ-kheo:
23
1126
1126
-- Này các Tỷ-kheo, một thời các Tỷ-kheo của Ta có tâm rất thuần thục hoan hỷ.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, Ta bảo các Tỷ-kheo, này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta theo hạnh nhất tọa thực.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, sống theo hạnh nhất tọa thực, Ta cảm thấy không bệnh tật, không ốm đau, nhẹ nhàng, khang kiện và sảng khoái.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ngươi hãy sống theo hạnh nhất tọa thực.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ngươi theo hạnh nhất tọa thực thời các Ngươi sẽ cảm thấy không bệnh tật, không ốm đau, nhẹ nhàng, khang kiện và sảng khoái.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta không cần phải giảng dạy gì cho các Tỷ-kheo ấy;
chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta chỉ cần khơi dậy ức niệm nơi các Tỷ-kheo ấy.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như trên đất bằng, tại chỗ ngã tư, có một chiếc xe đang đậu, thắng với ngựa hay, có roi ngựa đặt ngang sẵn sàng.
Có người mã thuật sư thiện xảo, người đánh xe điều ngự các con ngựa đáng được điều ngự, leo lên xe ấy, tay trái nắm lấy dây cương, tay mặt cầm lấy roi ngựa, có thể đánh xe ngựa ấy đi tới đi lui, tại chỗ nào và như thế nào, theo ý mình muốn.
Cũng vậy chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta không cần phải giảng dạy gì cho các Tỷ-kheo ấy;
chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta chỉ cần khơi dậy ức niệm nơi các Tỷ-kheo ấy.
24
884
2010
Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, hãy từ bỏ bất thiện, hãy nỗ lực đối với các thiện pháp, như vậy các Ngươi mới thành tựu sự trưởng thành, hưng thịnh, lớn mạnh trong Pháp và Luật này.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, cũng như gần một thôn làng hay thị trấn nhỏ, có ngôi rừng cây tala lớn, ngôi rừng bị các cây leo y lan bao phủ.
Có một người đến khu rừng này, muốn lợi ích cho ngôi rừng, muốn hạnh phúc, muốn an ổn khỏi các ách phược cho ngôi rừng.
Người ấy chặt đứt các nhành cây cong thiếu hẳn sinh lực, vất chúng ra khỏi ngôi rừng, dọn dẹp trong rừng sạch sẽ.
Người ấy săn sóc kỹ lưỡng các nhánh cây tala thẳng thắn, khéo mọc.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, sau một thời gian, ngôi rừng như vậy được trưởng thành, hưng thịnh, lớn mạnh.
Cũng vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ngươi hãy từ bỏ bất thiện, hãy nỗ lực đối với các thiện pháp, như vậy các Ngươi mới thành tựu sự trưởng thành, hưng thịnh, lớn mạnh trong Pháp và Luật này.

2805
Chư Tỷ-kheo, thuở xưa, tại thành Savatthi này có nữ gia chủ tên là Vedehika.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, tiếng đồn tốt đẹp sau đây được khởi lên về nữ gia chủ Vedehika:
"Nữ gia chủ Vedehika là hiền thục, nữ gia chủ Vedehika là nhu thuận;
nữ gia chủ Vedehika là ôn hòa".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ gia chủ Vedehika có người nữ tỳ tên là Kali, người này khéo tay, siêng năng, và làm việc cẩn thận chu toàn.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ tỳ Kali khởi lên ý nghĩ:
"Chủ của ta được tiếng đồn tốt đẹp khởi lên như sau:
"Nữ gia chủ Vedehika là hiền thục;
nữ gia chủ Vedehika là nhu thuận;
nữ gia chủ Vedehika là ôn hòa".
Không biết nữ chủ của ta có nội sân mà không tỏ lộ hay không có nội sân, hay vì công việc ta làm cẩn thận chu toàn nên nữ chủ ta có nội sân nhưng không tỏ lộ, không phải không có.
Vậy ta hãy thử nữ chủ của ta!"
26
109
2914
Chư Tỷ-kheo, rồi nữ tỳ Kali sáng ngày sau dậy thật trễ.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ gia chủ Vedehika nói với nữ tỳ Kali:
27
12
2926
-- Này Kali!
28
27
2953
-- Thưa Nữ chủ, có việc gì?
29
33
2986
-- Sao hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ vậy?
30
31
3017
-- Thưa nữ chủ, có việc gì đâu?
31
69
3086
-- Thật sự không có việc gì à?
Ác nữ tỳ kia, hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ!"
32
38
3124
Và nữ chủ phẫn nộ, bất mãn, trừng mắt.
33
268
3392
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ tỳ Kali suy nghĩ:
"Nữ chủ của ta thật sự có nội sân nhưng không tỏ lộ, không phải không có.
Vì những công việc ta làm cẩn thận chu toàn, nên nữ chủ của ta tuy có nội sân nhưng không tỏ lộ, không phải không có.
Vậy Ta hãy thử thêm nữa nữ chủ của ta!"
34
107
3499
Chư Tỷ-kheo, rồi nữ tỳ Kali ngày sau lại dậy trễ hơn nữa.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ chủ Vedehika nói với nữ tỳ Kali:
35
12
3511
-- Này Kali!
36
27
3538
-- Thưa Nữ chủ, có việc gì?
37
33
3571
-- Sao hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ vậy?
38
31
3602
-- Thưa Nữ chủ, có việc gì đâu?
39
68
3670
-- Thật sự không có việc gì à?
Ác nữ tỳ kia, hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ!
40
55
3725
Và nữ chủ phẫn nộ, bất mãn, thốt lên những lời bất mãn.
41
267
3992
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ tỳ Kali suy nghĩ:
"Nữ chủ của ta thật sự có nội sân nhưng không tỏ lộ, không phải không có.
Vì những công việc ta làm cẩn thận chu toàn nên nữ chủ của ta tuy có nội sân nhưng không tỏ lộ, không phải không có.
Vậy ta hãy thử thêm nữa nữ chủ của ta!"
42
111
4103
Chư Tỷ-kheo, rồi nữ tỳ Kali sáng hôm sau lại dậy trễ hơn nữa.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ chủ Vedehika nói với nữ tỳ Kali:
43
12
4115
-- Này Kali!
44
27
4142
-- Thưa Nữ chủ, có việc gì?
45
33
4175
-- Sao hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ vậy?
46
31
31
-- Thưa Nữ chủ, có việc gì đâu?
47
68
99
-- Thật sự không có việc gì à?
Ác nữ tỳ kia, hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ!
48
95
194
Rồi phẫn nộ, không hoan hỷ, nàng cầm cái then gài cửa, đánh một cú trên đầu nữ tỳ khiến bể đầu.
49
83
277
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nữ tỳ Kali, với đầu bể máu chảy, liền đi kể lể với các nhà láng giềng:
50
265
542
-- Hãy xem việc làm của nữ chủ hiền thục!
Hãy xem việc làm của nữ chủ nhu thuận!
Hãy xem việc làm của nữ chủ ôn hòa!
Sao nữ chủ nói với nữ tỳ độc nhất:
"Hôm nay Ngươi dậy trễ", rồi phẫn nộ, bất mãn, nàng cầm then gài cửa, đánh tôi một cú trên đầu khiến bể đầu".
51
188
730
Chư Tỷ-kheo, sau một thời gian, tiếng đồn xấu sau đây được khởi lên về nữ chủ Vedehika:
"Nữ chủ Vedehika là độc ác!
Nữ chủ Vedehika là không nhu thuận!
Nữ chủ Vedehika là không ôn hòa!"
52
1050
1780
Cũng vậy chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, Tỷ-kheo hết sức hiền lành, hết sức nhu thuận, hết sức ôn hòa trong khi chưa bị những lời nói bất khả ý, xúc phạm.
Và chư Tỷ-kheo, chỉ khi nào Tỷ-kheo bị những lời nói bất khả ý, xúc phạm mà vị ấy vẫn hết sức hiền lành, hết sức nhu thuận, hết sức ôn hòa, khi ấy vị ấy mới được xem là hiền lành, mới được xem là nhu thuận, mới được xem là ôn hòa.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta không gọi một Tỷ-kheo là dễ nói, khi vị ấy dễ nói về các vật dụng như y áo, món ăn, sàng tọa, dược phẩm trị bệnh, khi vị ấy thành tựu được tánh dễ nói.
Vì sao vậy?
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo ấy khi không được các vật dụng như y áo, thức ăn, sàng tọa, dược phẩm trị bệnh, không còn là dễ nói, không còn thành tựu tánh dễ nói.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo nào tôn trọng Pháp, cung kính Pháp, sùng kính Pháp trở thành dễ nói, thành tựu tánh dễ nói, vị ấy Ta mới gọi là dễ nói.
Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, hãy suy nghĩ:
"Chỉ vì tôn trọng Pháp, cung kính Pháp, sùng kính Pháp chúng ta sẽ trở thành dễ nói, thành tựu tánh dễ nói".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ngươi phải học tập như vậy.
53
1188
2968
Chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ mà các Ngươi có thể dùng khi nói với các người khác:
đúng thời hay phi thời, chơn thực hay không chơn thực, nhu nhuyến hay thô bạo, có lợi ích hay không lợi ích, với từ tâm hay với sân tâm.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói đúng thời hay phi thời.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói lời chơn thực hay nói lời không chơn thực.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói lời nhu nhuyến hay nói lời thô bạo.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói lời lợi ích hay nói lời không lợi ích.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói với từ tâm hay với sân tâm.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở tại đây, các Ngươi cần phải học tập như sau:
"Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm, chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ, chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận.
Chúng ta sẽ sống bao phủ người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.
Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng địa vô biên, không hận, không sân".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy các Ngươi cần phải học tập.
54
413
3381
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người đến, cầm xẻng và thúng, nói như sau:
"Tôi sẽ làm cho đất lớn này không thành đất nữa", và người ấy đào chỗ này chỗ kia, rải đất chỗ này chỗ kia, nhổ nước miếng chỗ này chỗ kia, đi tiểu tiện chỗ này chỗ kia, với ý nghĩ:
"Ngươi trở thành không phải đất, Ngươi trở thành không phải đất".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nghĩ thế nào?
Người ấy có thể làm cho đất lớn này trở thành không phải đất chăng?
55
182
3563
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
Vì sao vậy?
Vì đất lớn này thâm sâu và vô lượng, không dễ gì khiến cho đất lớn này trở thành không phải đất, trước khi người ấy bị mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.
56
715
715
-- Cũng vậy, này chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ này mà các Ông có thể nói với người khác:
"Ðúng thời hay phi thời...
hay với sân tâm".
Các Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói:
"Ðúng thời...
hay với sân tâm".
Các Tỷ-kheo, ở tại đây, các Ông cần phải học tập như sau:
"Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm;
chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ;
chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận;
chúng ta sẽ sống biến mãn người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.
Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới, với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".
Các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.
57
332
1047
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người đến, cầm màu sơn, màu vàng, màu xanh sẫm hay màu đỏ tía;
người ấy có thể nói như sau:
"Ta sẽ viết các hình sắc trên hư không này.
Ta sẽ làm cho các hình sắc hiển hiện".
Các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Người ấy có thể viết các hình sắc trên hư không và làm cho các hình sắc hiển hiện được không?
58
214
1261
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không thể được.
Vì sao vậy?
Bạch Thế Tôn, hư không là vô sắc, không thể thấy được.
Ở đây, không dễ gì viết các hình sắc và làm hình sắc hiển hiện, trước khi người ấy bị mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.
59
334
1595
-- Cũng vậy, này Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ này mà các Ông có thể nói với người khác:
"Ðúng thời hay phi thời...
hay với sân tâm...
(như trên)...
Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.
60
269
1864
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người đến, cầm một bó cỏ khô đang cháy và nói như sau:
"Ta với bó cỏ khô đang cháy này sẽ hâm nóng và đun sôi sông Hằng này.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Người ấy, với bỏ cỏ khô đang cháy có thể hâm nóng và đun sôi sông Hằng được không?
61
210
2074
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
Vì sao vậy?
Bạch Thế Tôn, vì sông Hằng thâm sâu và vô lượng, không dễ gì với bó cỏ khô đang cháy có thể hâm nóng và đun sôi sông Hằng được, trước khi người ấy mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.
62
438
2512
-- Cũng vậy, này chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ này mà các Ông có thể nói với các người khác:
"Ðúng thời hay phi thời...
hay với sân tâm".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói:
"Ðúng thời...
hay với sân tâm...
(như trên)...
Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.
63
684
3196
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một cái bị bằng da mèo, đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyến, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, và một người đến, cầm gậy hay cầm mẻ sành và nói như sau:
"Ta sẽ lấy cái gậy hay với cái mẻ sành làm cho cái bị bằng da mèo này, đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyễn, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, phát ra tiếng xì, tiếng xọp".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Người ấy có thể, với cái gậy hay với cái mẻ sành làm cho cái bị bằng da mèo này đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyễn, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, phát ra tiếng xì, tiếng xọp được không?
64
293
3489
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
Vì sao vậy?
Bạch Thế Tôn, cái bị bằng da mèo này đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyễn, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, không dễ gì làm cho cái bị ấy phát ra tiếng xì, tiếng xọp được, trước khi người ấy bị mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.
65
1188
1188
-- Cũng vậy, chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ mà các Ông có thể dùng khi nói với các người khác:
"Ðúng thời hay phi thời, chơn thực hay không chơn thực, nhu nhuyễn hay thô bạo, có lợi ích hay không lợi ích, với từ tâm hay với sân tâm".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói đúng thời hay phi thời.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói lời chơn thực hay nói lời không chơn thực.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói lời nhu nhuyễn hay nói lời thô bạo.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói lời lợi ích hay nói lời không lợi ích.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói với từ tâm hay với sân tâm.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở tại đây, các Ông cần phải học tập như sau:
"Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm, chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ;
chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận.
Chúng ta sẽ sống biến mãn người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.
Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân" Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.
66
661
1849
Chư Tỷ-kheo, như những kẻ đạo tặc hạ liệt, dùng cưa hai lưỡi mà cưa tay, cưa chân;
dầu vậy, nếu một ai ở đây khởi ý nhiễm loạn, người ấy do vậy không phải là người thực hành giáo pháp của Ta.
Ở đây, chư Tỷ-kheo các Ông phải học tập như sau:
"Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm;
chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ;
chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận.
Chúng ta sẽ sống bao phủ người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.
Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.
67
193
2042
Và này chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu các Ông luôn luôn suy tư lời dạy ví dụ cái cưa này, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thấy loại ngôn ngữ nào, dầu tế nhị hay thô bạo mà các Ông không kham nhẫn được chăng?
68
23
2065
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
69
118
2183
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, do vậy, hãy luôn luôn suy tư lời dạy ví như cái cưa này, và các Ông sẽ được hạnh phúc an lạc lâu ngày.
70
79
2262
Thế Tôn thuyết giảng như vậy.
Các Tỷ-kheo ấy hoan hỷ, tín thọ lời Thế Tôn dạy.
