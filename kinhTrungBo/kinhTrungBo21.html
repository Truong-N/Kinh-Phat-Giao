After arriving, he paid homage to the Buddha and sat down to one side.~ After sitting down to one side, the bhikkhu said to the Buddha:~~ -- Venerable Lord, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in excessively close contact with the bhikkhunis.~ Venerable Lord, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna lived in such a way with the bhikkhunis:~ If any bhikkhu spoke ill of those bhikkhunis in the presence of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna would immediately become angry, displeased, and question him;~ if any bhikkhu spoke ill of the Venerable Moliya Phagguna in the presence of those bhikkhunis, those bhikkhunis would immediately become angry, displeased, and question him.~ "Venerable Lord, the Venerable Moliya Phagguna lives in excessive association with the bhikkhunis in this way."~~ The Buddha called another bhikkhu and said:~~ "Bhikkhu, go, in my name, and call the bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna:~ "Venerable Phagguna, the Master is calling you."~~ "Yes, Venerable Lord!"~~ The bhikkhu obeyed the Buddha and went to where the Venerable Moliya Phagguna was. When he arrived, he said to the Venerable Moliya Phagguna:~~ "Venerable Moliya Phagguna, the Master is calling you."~~ "Yes, Venerable."~~ The bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna obeyed the bhikkhu and went to where the Buddha was. When he arrived, he paid homage to the Buddha and sat down to one side.~ The Buddha said to Venerable Moliya Phagguna, who was seated to one side:~~ -- Phagguna, is it true that it is said that you associate excessively with the nuns?~ It is said that you associate with the nuns in this way:~ "If any monk speaks ill of those nuns in your presence, you immediately become angry, displeased, and question him;~ if any monk speaks ill of you in the presence of those nuns, those nuns immediately become angry, displeased, and question him."~ Phagguna, is it true that you associate with the nuns in this way?~~ -- Yes, Lord.~~ -- Phagguna, are you a good man who, out of faith, has renounced his family and lives without a family?~~ -- Yes, Venerable Lord.~~ -- Phagguna, it is unworthy of you, a good man, to have renounced your family and become a householder out of faith, to associate excessively with nuns in this way.~ Therefore, Phagguna, if anyone speaks ill of those nuns before you, Phagguna, you must abandon worldly desires and worldly thoughts.~ Phagguna, you must learn as follows:~ "May my mind not be defiled!~ May I not speak evil words!~ May I live with compassion, with a loving-kind heart, without harboring anger!" Phagguna, you must learn in this way.~~ Therefore, Phagguna, if someone in your presence strikes those bhikkhunis with their hands, throws earth at them, beats them with sticks, or strikes them with swords, Phagguna, you must abandon those desires...~ and not harbor resentment.~ Phagguna, you must learn to do so.~ Therefore, Phagguna, if someone in your presence speaks ill of someone, Phagguna, you must abandon those desires...~ and not harbor resentment.~ Phagguna, you must learn to do so.~ Therefore, Phagguna, if someone in your presence strikes them with their hands, throws earth at them, beats them with sticks, or strikes them with swords, Phagguna, you must abandon those desires related to worldly things, those thoughts related to worldly things.~ "Phaguna, you must learn as follows:~ May my mind remain undefiled!~ May I not speak evil words!~ May I live with compassion, with a loving-kind heart, without harboring anger!" Thus, Phagguna, you must learn.~~ Then the Blessed One said to the monks:~~ -- Monks, at one time my monks were very pure and joyful.~ Monks, I say to you, monks, I practiced the asceticism of sitting still for a meal.~ Monks, by practicing the asceticism of sitting still for a meal, I felt free from sickness and pain, light, healthy, and refreshed.~ Monks, you should practice the asceticism of sitting still for a meal.~ Monks, by practicing the asceticism of sitting still for a meal, you will feel free from sickness and pain, light, healthy, and refreshed.~ Monks, I do not need to teach them anything;~ monks, I only need to awaken mindfulness in them.~ Bhikkhus, it is as if on level ground, at a crossroads, there is a chariot parked, harnessed to fine horses, with a whip ready.~ A skilled charioteer, who controls the horses well, climbs into the chariot, grasping the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right, and can drive the chariot back and forth, wherever and however he wishes.~ Similarly, Bhikkhus, I do not need to teach them anything;~ Bhikkhus, I only need to awaken their mindfulness.~~ Therefore, Bhikkhus, abandon unwholesome actions and strive for wholesome actions; in this way, you will achieve maturity, prosperity, and strength in this Dharma and Vinaya.~ Bhikkhus, just as near a small village or town there is a large tala forest, a forest covered with ylang-ylang vines.~ A person comes to this forest, wanting to benefit the forest, wanting happiness, wanting to free the forest from its entanglements.~ That person cuts off the crooked, lifeless branches, throws them out of the forest, and cleans the forest thoroughly.~ That person carefully tends to the straight, healthy tala branches.~ Bhikkhus, after some time, such a forest grows, flourishes, and becomes strong.~ Similarly, Bhikkhus, you should abandon unwholesome actions and strive for wholesome actions; in this way, you will achieve growth, flourishing, and strength in this Dharma and Vinaya.~~ Bhikkhus, in ancient times, in this city of Savatthi, there was a female householder named Vedehika.~ Bhikkhus, the following good reputation has arisen concerning the householder Vedehika:~ "The householder Vedehika is virtuous, the householder Vedehika is gentle;~ the householder Vedehika is mild-mannered."~ Bhikkhus, the householder Vedehika has a maidservant named Kali, who is skillful, diligent, and meticulous in her work.~ Bhikkhus, the maidservant Kali thought:~ "My mistress has such a good reputation:~ "The householder Vedehika is virtuous;~ the householder Vedehika is gentle;~ the householder Vedehika is mild-mannered."~ I wonder if my mistress has anger that she doesn't show, or if she has no anger at all, or if, because of my meticulous work, she has anger but doesn't show it—or if she doesn't have it at all.~ Then let me test my mistress!"~~ Bhikkhus, the maid Kali woke up very late the next morning.~ Bhikkhus, the householder Vedehika said to the maid Kali:~~ -- Kali!~~ -- Mistress, what is the matter?~~ -- Why did you wake up so late today?~~ -- Mistress, there is nothing wrong.~~ -- Is there really nothing wrong?~ You wicked maid, you woke up late today!~~ And the mistress was angry and displeased, glaring.~~ Bhikkhus, the maid Kali thought:~ "My mistress truly has inner anger, but she doesn't show it. It's not that she doesn't have it.~ Because of the careful and thorough work I do, my mistress, though she has inner anger, doesn't show it. It's not that she doesn't have it."~ "Then let me test my mistress again!"~~ Bhikkhus, the maid Kali woke up even later the next day.~ Bhikkhus, the mistress Vedehika said to the maid Kali:~~ -- Kali!~~ -- Mistress, what is it?~~ -- Why did you wake up so late today?~~ -- Mistress, there is nothing wrong.~~ -- Is there really nothing wrong?~ You wicked maid, you woke up late today!~~ And the mistress, in her anger and dissatisfaction, uttered words of displeasure.~~ Bhikkhus, the maid Kali thought:~ "My mistress truly has inner anger, but she doesn't show it. It's not that she doesn't have it.~ Because of the careful and thorough work I do, my mistress, though she has inner anger, doesn't show it. It's not that she doesn't have it."~ "Then let's try my mistress again!"~~ Bhikkhus, the maid Kali woke up even later the next morning.~ Bhikkhus, the mistress Vedehika said to the maid Kali:~~ -- Kali!~~ -- Mistress, what is it?~~ -- Why did you wake up so late today?~~ -- Mistress, there's nothing wrong.~~ -- Really nothing wrong?~ You wicked maid, you woke up late today!~~ Then, in anger and displeasure, she took the door latch and struck the maid on the head, causing her head to split open.~~ Bhikkhus, the maid Kali, with her head bleeding from the wound, went and complained to the neighbors:~~ -- Look at the virtuous mistress's conduct!~ Look at the gentle mistress's conduct!~ Look at the kind mistress's conduct!~ Why did the mistress say to her only maid:~ "You woke up late today," and in anger and displeasure, she took the door latch and struck me on the head, causing my head to split open?~~ Bhikkhus, after some time, the following bad rumors arose about the mistress Vedehika:~ "The mistress Vedehika is wicked!~ The mistress Vedehika is not gentle!"~ "The female owner Vedehika is not gentle!"~~ Similarly, monks, here, a monk is extremely gentle, extremely compliant, extremely mild-mannered while he has not yet been subjected to unpleasant or offensive words.~ And, monks, only when a monk is subjected to unpleasant or offensive words, and he remains extremely gentle, extremely compliant, extremely mild-mannered, only then is he considered gentle, compliant, and mild-mannered.~ Monks, I do not call a monk eloquent when he is eloquent in speaking about things like robes, food, bedding, or medicine, when he has attained the quality of eloquence.~ Why is that?~ Monks, when that monk does not have things like robes, food, bedding, or medicine, he is no longer eloquent, he has no longer attained the quality of eloquence.~ Monks Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who respects the Dharma, reveres the Dharma, and venerates the Dharma becomes eloquent, who achieves the quality of eloquence—that is the one I call eloquent.~ Therefore, bhikkhus, reflect:~ "Only by respecting the Dharma, reveres the Dharma, and venerates the Dharma will we become eloquent, who achieve the quality of eloquence."~ Bhikkhus, you must learn in this way.~~ Bhikkhus, there are five kinds of language that you can use when speaking to others:~ timely or untimely, truthful or untrue, gentle or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with compassion or with anger.~ Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you can speak at the right time or at the wrong time.~ Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you can speak truthfully or untruthfully.~ Bhikkhus, When speaking to others, you may speak gently or harshly.~ Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak beneficially or unbeneficially.~ Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you may speak with loving-kindness or with anger.~ Bhikkhus, here you should learn as follows:~ "We will keep our minds undefiled; we will not utter harsh words; we will live with compassion, with loving-kindness, with an inner peace free from anger.~ We will surround this person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness."~ And with this person as the object, we live pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, boundless and infinite, without hatred, without anger.”~ Bhikkhus, thus you should learn.~~ Bhikkhus, imagine a person coming, holding a shovel and a basket, saying:~ “I will make this great earth no longer earth,” and that person digs here and there, scatters earth here and there, spits here and there, urinates here and there, thinking:~ “You will become not earth, you will become not earth.”~ Bhikkhus, what do you think?~ Can that person make this great earth become not earth?~~ -- Venerable Lord, no.~ Why?~ Because this great earth is deep and immeasurable, it is not easy to make this great earth become not earth before that person becomes weary and fails.~~ -- Also So, monks, there are five kinds of speech that you may use when speaking to others:~ "At the right time or at the wrong time...~ or with anger."~ Monks, when speaking to others, you may say:~ "At the right time...~ or with anger."~ Monks, here you should learn as follows:~ "We will keep our minds undefiled;~ we will not utter harsh words;~ we will live with compassion, with loving-kindness, with an inner mind free from anger;~ we will permeate this person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness."~ And with this person as the object, we live pervading the entire world, with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger."~ Monks, you should learn in this way.~~ Monks, imagine a person coming with paint, yellow, dark blue, or purple;~ He might say:~ "I will write colors in this empty space.~ I will make colors appear."~ Monks, what do you think?~ Can he write colors in the empty space and make colors appear?~~ -- Venerable Lord, it cannot.~ Why?~ Venerable Lord, the empty space is formless, invisible.~ Here, it is not easy to write colors and make colors appear before he becomes weary and fails.~~ -- Likewise, monks, there are five kinds of language that you may speak to others:~ "At the right time or at the wrong time...~ or with anger...~ (as above)...~ And with this person as the object, I pervade the entire world with a mind endowed with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger."~ Monks, you should learn in this way.~~ Bhikkhus, suppose a man comes, holding a burning bundle of dry grass, and says:~ "With this burning bundle of dry grass, I will heat and boil the Ganges River."~ Bhikkhus, what do you think?~ Can that man, with this burning bundle of dry grass, heat and boil the Ganges River?~~ -- No, Venerable Lord.~ Why is that?~ Venerable Lord, because the Ganges River is deep and immeasurable; it is not easy for a burning bundle of dry grass to heat and boil the Ganges River before that man becomes exhausted and fails.~~ -- Likewise, Bhikkhus, there are five kinds of language that you can use when speaking to others:~ "At the right time or at the wrong time...~ or with anger."~ Bhikkhus, when speaking to others, you can say:~ "At the right time...~ or with anger." mind...~ (as above)...~ And with this person as the object, we live pervading the entire world with a mind endowed with loving-kindness, vast, boundless, without hatred, without anger."~ Bhikkhus, you should learn in this way.~~ -- Bhikkhus, it is like a cat skin bag, tanned thoroughly, skillfully tanned, soft like cotton, without any hissing or popping sound, and a person comes, holding a stick or a piece of pottery, and says:~ "I will take the stick or the piece of pottery and make this cat skin bag, which has been tanned thoroughly, skillfully tanned, soft like cotton, without any hissing or popping sound, make it hiss or pop."~ Bhikkhus, what do you think?~ That person can, with the stick or the piece of pottery, make this cat skin bag, which has been tanned thoroughly, skillfully tanned, soft like cotton, without any hissing or popping sound, Soft, like cotton, without any hissing or popping sounds, can it make a hissing or popping sound?~~ -- No, Venerable Lord.~ Why is that?~ Venerable Lord, this catskin bag has been tanned thoroughly, skillfully tanned, and is soft, like cotton, without any hissing or popping sounds.

dậy trễ", rồi phẫn nộ, bất mãn, nàng cầm then gài cửa, đánh tôi một cú trên đầu khiến bể đầu".~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, sau một thời gian, tiếng đồn xấu sau đây được khởi lên về nữ chủ Vedehika:~ "Nữ chủ Vedehika là độc ác!~ Nữ chủ Vedehika là không nhu thuận!~ Nữ chủ Vedehika là không ôn hòa!"~~ Cũng vậy chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, Tỷ-kheo hết sức hiền lành, hết sức nhu thuận, hết sức ôn hòa trong khi chưa bị những lời nói bất khả ý, xúc phạm.~ Và chư Tỷ-kheo, chỉ khi nào Tỷ-kheo bị những lời nói bất khả ý, xúc phạm mà vị ấy vẫn hết sức hiền lành, hết sức nhu thuận, hết sức ôn hòa, khi ấy vị ấy mới được xem là hiền lành, mới được xem là nhu thuận, mới được xem là ôn hòa.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta không gọi một Tỷ-kheo là dễ nói, khi vị ấy dễ nói về các vật dụng như y áo, món ăn, sàng tọa, dược phẩm trị bệnh, khi vị ấy thành tựu được tánh dễ nói.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo ấy khi không được các vật dụng như y áo, thức ăn, sàng tọa, dược phẩm trị bệnh, không còn là dễ nói, không còn thành tựu tánh dễ nói.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo nào tôn trọng Pháp, cung kính Pháp, sùng kính Pháp trở thành dễ nói, thành tựu tánh dễ nói, vị ấy Ta mới gọi là dễ nói.~ Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, hãy suy nghĩ:~ "Chỉ vì tôn trọng Pháp, cung kính Pháp, sùng kính Pháp chúng ta sẽ trở thành dễ nói, thành tựu tánh dễ nói".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ngươi phải học tập như vậy.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ mà các Ngươi có thể dùng khi nói với các người khác:~ đúng thời hay phi thời, chơn thực hay không chơn thực, nhu nhuyến hay thô bạo, có lợi ích hay không lợi ích, với từ tâm hay với sân tâm.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói đúng thời hay phi thời.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói lời chơn thực hay nói lời không chơn thực.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói lời nhu nhuyến hay nói lời thô bạo.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói lời lợi ích hay nói lời không lợi ích.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ngươi có thể nói với từ tâm hay với sân tâm.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở tại đây, các Ngươi cần phải học tập như sau:~ "Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm, chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ, chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận.~ Chúng ta sẽ sống bao phủ người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.~ Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng địa vô biên, không hận, không sân".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy các Ngươi cần phải học tập.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người đến, cầm xẻng và thúng, nói như sau:~ "Tôi sẽ làm cho đất lớn này không thành đất nữa", và người ấy đào chỗ này chỗ kia, rải đất chỗ này chỗ kia, nhổ nước miếng chỗ này chỗ kia, đi tiểu tiện chỗ này chỗ kia, với ý nghĩ:~ "Ngươi trở thành không phải đất, Ngươi trở thành không phải đất".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, nghĩ thế nào?~ Người ấy có thể làm cho đất lớn này trở thành không phải đất chăng?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Vì đất lớn này thâm sâu và vô lượng, không dễ gì khiến cho đất lớn này trở thành không phải đất, trước khi người ấy bị mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.~~ -- Cũng vậy, này chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ này mà các Ông có thể nói với người khác:~ "Ðúng thời hay phi thời...~ hay với sân tâm".~ Các Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói:~ "Ðúng thời...~ hay với sân tâm".~ Các Tỷ-kheo, ở tại đây, các Ông cần phải học tập như sau:~ "Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm;~ chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ;~ chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận;~ chúng ta sẽ sống biến mãn người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.~ Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới, với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".~ Các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người đến, cầm màu sơn, màu vàng, màu xanh sẫm hay màu đỏ tía;~ người ấy có thể nói như sau:~ "Ta sẽ viết các hình sắc trên hư không này.~ Ta sẽ làm cho các hình sắc hiển hiện".~ Các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?~ Người ấy có thể viết các hình sắc trên hư không và làm cho các hình sắc hiển hiện được không?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không thể được.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Bạch Thế Tôn, hư không là vô sắc, không thể thấy được.~ Ở đây, không dễ gì viết các hình sắc và làm hình sắc hiển hiện, trước khi người ấy bị mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.~~ -- Cũng vậy, này Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ này mà các Ông có thể nói với người khác:~ "Ðúng thời hay phi thời...~ hay với sân tâm...~ (như trên)...~ Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người đến, cầm một bó cỏ khô đang cháy và nói như sau:~ "Ta với bó cỏ khô đang cháy này sẽ hâm nóng và đun sôi sông Hằng này.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?~ Người ấy, với bỏ cỏ khô đang cháy có thể hâm nóng và đun sôi sông Hằng được không?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Bạch Thế Tôn, vì sông Hằng thâm sâu và vô lượng, không dễ gì với bó cỏ khô đang cháy có thể hâm nóng và đun sôi sông Hằng được, trước khi người ấy mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.~~ -- Cũng vậy, này chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ này mà các Ông có thể nói với các người khác:~ "Ðúng thời hay phi thời...~ hay với sân tâm".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói:~ "Ðúng thời...~ hay với sân tâm...~ (như trên)...~ Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.~~ -- Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một cái bị bằng da mèo, đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyến, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, và một người đến, cầm gậy hay cầm mẻ sành và nói như sau:~ "Ta sẽ lấy cái gậy hay với cái mẻ sành làm cho cái bị bằng da mèo này, đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyễn, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, phát ra tiếng xì, tiếng xọp".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?~ Người ấy có thể, với cái gậy hay với cái mẻ sành làm cho cái bị bằng da mèo này đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyễn, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, phát ra tiếng xì, tiếng xọp được không?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Bạch Thế Tôn, cái bị bằng da mèo này đã được thuộc chín, khéo thuộc, khéo thuộc cùng khắp, nhu nhuyễn, như bông, không còn tiếng xì, tiếng xọp, không dễ gì làm cho cái bị ấy phát ra tiếng xì, tiếng xọp được, trước khi người ấy bị mệt nhoài và bị thất bại.~~ -- Cũng vậy, chư Tỷ-kheo, có năm loại ngôn ngữ mà các Ông có thể dùng khi nói với các người khác:~ "Ðúng thời hay phi thời, chơn thực hay không chơn thực, nhu nhuyễn hay thô bạo, có lợi ích hay không lợi ích, với từ tâm hay với sân tâm".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói đúng thời hay phi thời.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói lời chơn thực hay nói lời không chơn thực.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói lời nhu nhuyễn hay nói lời thô bạo.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói lời lợi ích hay nói lời không lợi ích.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, khi nói với các người khác, các Ông có thể nói với từ tâm hay với sân tâm.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở tại đây, các Ông cần phải học tập như sau:~ "Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm, chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ;~ chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận.~ Chúng ta sẽ sống biến mãn người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.~ Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân" Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, như những kẻ đạo tặc hạ liệt, dùng cưa hai lưỡi mà cưa tay, cưa chân;~ dầu vậy, nếu một ai ở đây khởi ý nhiễm loạn, người ấy do vậy không phải là người thực hành giáo pháp của Ta.~ Ở đây, chư Tỷ-kheo các Ông phải học tập như sau:~ "Chúng ta sẽ giữ tâm của chúng ta không biến nhiễm;~ chúng ta sẽ không thốt ra những lời ác ngữ;~ chúng ta sẽ sống với lòng lân mẫn, với tâm từ bi, với nội tâm không sân hận.~ Chúng ta sẽ sống bao phủ người này với tâm câu hữu với từ.~ Và với người này là đối tượng, ta sống biến mãn cùng khắp thế giới với tâm câu hữu với từ, quảng đại, vô biên, không hận, không sân".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần phải học tập như vậy.~~ Và này chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu các Ông luôn luôn suy tư lời dạy ví dụ cái cưa này, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thấy loại ngôn ngữ nào, dầu tế nhị hay thô bạo mà các Ông không kham nhẫn được chăng?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.~~ -- Chư Tỷ-kheo, do vậy, hãy luôn luôn suy tư lời dạy ví như cái cưa này, và các Ông sẽ được hạnh phúc an lạc lâu ngày.~~ Thế Tôn thuyết giảng như vậy.~ Các Tỷ-kheo ấy hoan hỷ, tín thọ lời Thế Tôn dạy.~ `
