The Discourse on Mindfulness

(Satipatthàna sutta)
4
17
85
Thus I have heard.
5
123
208
At one time the Blessed One was in the land of Kuru, Kammassadhamma, the city of Kuru.
Then the Blessed One called the monks:
6
19
227
-- Monks.
7
29
256
The monks answered the Blessed One:
8
16
272
-- Blessed One.
9
23
295
The Buddha said as follows:
10
177
472
-- O monks, this is the only path that leads to purity for beings, to transcend sorrow, to eliminate suffering, to attain right knowledge, and to realize Nirvana.
That is the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.
11
394
866
What are the four?
O monks, here a monk dwells contemplating the body on the body, ardently, mindfully, and with right mindfulness to overcome craving and sorrow in the world;
living contemplating feelings on feelings, ardently, mindfully, and with right mindfulness to overcome craving and sorrow in the world;
living contemplating the mind on the mind, ardently, mindfully, and with right mindfulness to overcome craving and sorrow in the world;
living contemplating phenomena on phenomena, ardently, mindfully, and with right mindfulness to overcome craving and sorrow in the world.
12
11
877
(Contemplation of the Body)
13
1236
2113
And, monks, what is it for a monk to contemplate the body on the body?
Here, monks, a monk goes to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty house, and sits cross-legged, with his back straight, and establishes mindfulness before him.
Aware, he breathes in;
Aware, he breathes out.
He breathes in deeply, and he understands:
"I breathe in deeply";
or he breathes out deeply, and he understands:
"I breathe out deeply";
He breathes in briefly, and he understands:
"I breathe in briefly";
He breathes out briefly, and he understands:
"I breathe out briefly."
"Feeling the whole body, I will breathe in," he practices;
"Feeling the whole body, I will breathe out," he practices;
"With a calm body, I will breathe in," he practices;
"With a calm body, I will breathe out," he practices.
Bhikkhus, just as a skilled windmill operator or his apprentice, when turning a long turn, understands:
"I am turning long" or when turning a short turn, understands:
"I am turning short."
Similarly, Bhikkhus, a monk who breathes in a long breath understands:
"I am breathing in long";
or breathes out a long breath, understands:
"I am breathing out long";
or breathes in a short breath, understands:
"I am breathing in short";
or breathes out a short breath, understands:
"I am breathing out short."
"With a feeling in the whole body, I will breathe in," he practices;
"With a feeling in the whole body, I will breathe out," he practices;
"With a calm body, I will breathe in," he practices;
"With a calm body, I will breathe out," he practices.
14
475
2588
Thus, he dwells contemplating the body within the body or contemplates the body outside the body;
or contemplates the body on both the inner and outer body;
or he dwells contemplating the arising of the body;
or contemplates the cessation of the body;
or contemplates the arising and cessation of the body.
“There is a body here,” he abides in mindfulness in this way, hoping to attain right knowledge, right mindfulness.
And he does not rely on or cling to anything in the world.
This, monks, is how a monk dwells contemplating the body within the body.
15
218
2806
Furthermore, monks, a monk walks and understands:
“I am walking,” or stands and understands:
“I am standing,” or sits and understands:
“I am sitting,” or lies down and understands:
"I am lying down."
The body is used in a certain way, and that is how he understands the body.
16
498
3304
He dwells contemplating the body within the body;
or he dwells contemplating the body outside the body;
or he dwells contemplating the body both inside and outside the body;
or he dwells contemplating the arising of the body;
or he dwells contemplating the cessation of the body;
or he dwells contemplating the arising and cessation of the body.
“There is a body here,” he abides in mindfulness in this way, hoping to attain right knowledge, right mindfulness.
And he lives without reliance on, without attachment to anything in the world.
This, monks, is how a monk dwells contemplating the body within the body.
17
455
3759
Furthermore, monks, a monk, when walking back and forth, knows clearly what he is doing;
when looking back and forth, knows clearly what he is doing;
when bending his arm, when extending his arm, knows clearly what he is doing;
When wearing the Sanghati robe, carrying the bowl, wearing the monastic garment, be fully aware of what you are doing;
when eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, be fully aware of what you are doing;
when defecating, urinating, be fully aware of what you are doing;
when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, being silent, be fully aware of what you are doing.
18
486
486
Thus, he dwells contemplating the body within the body;
or dwells contemplating the body outside the body;
or dwells contemplating the body on both the inside and outside of the body.
Or he dwells contemplating the arising of the body;
or dwells contemplating the cessation of the body;
or dwells contemplating the arising and cessation of the body.
“There is a body here,” he abides in mindfulness in this way, hoping to attain right knowledge, right mindfulness.
And he lives without reliance on, without attachment to anything in the world.
This, monks, is how a monk dwells contemplating the body within the body.
19
1107
1593
Furthermore, monks, a monk observes this body, from the soles of his feet upwards, to the crown of his head, covered by skin and filled with various impure substances.
In this body:
"These are hair, fur, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, kidneys, marrow, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, intestinal membrane, abdomen, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin fat, saliva, mucus, joint fluid, urine."
"This, monks, is like a sack, empty at both ends, filled with various grains such as rice, wheat, mung beans, broad beans, sesame seeds, and milled rice.
A person with eyes pours out these grains and observes:
"This is rice, this is wheat, this is mung bean, this is broad bean, this is sesame, this is milled wheat."

20
482

or dwells contemplating the body outside the body, or dwells contemplating the body both inside and outside the body.
Or he dwells contemplating the arising of the body;
or dwells contemplating the cessation of the body;
or dwells contemplating the arising and cessation of the body.

And he lives without reliance on, without attachment to, anything in the world.
This, monks, is how a monk dwells contemplating the body within the body.
21
465
2540
Furthermore, monks, a monk contemplates this body in terms of the positions of the elements and their arrangement:
"In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the wind element."
Monks, just as a skilled butcher, or a butcher's apprentice, slaughters an ox and sits cutting it into pieces at a crossroads,
Similarly, monks, a monk contemplates this body in terms of the positions of the elements and their arrangement:
"In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the wind element."

23
283
3306
Furthermore, monks, a monk sees a corpse abandoned in a cemetery for one day, two days, three days, and the corpse swells up, turns dark green, and rots.
The monk contemplates that body as follows:
"This body is of such a nature, its essence is such, it cannot transcend such a nature."

25

The monk contemplates that body as follows:
"This body is of such nature, its essence is such, it cannot transcend such nature."

1187
"Now, monks, again, a monk sees a body thrown into a graveyard, with the bones still connected, still attached to flesh and blood, still bound by tendons...
with the bones still connected, no longer attached to flesh but still attached to blood, still bound by tendons...
with the bones no longer attached to flesh and blood, still bound by tendons, only the bones not attached to each other, scattered here and there.
Here are the arm bones, here are the leg bones, here are the tibia bones, here are the hip bones, here are the spine bones, here are the skull bones.
The monk contemplates that body as follows:
"This body is of such a nature, its essence is such, it cannot transcend that nature."
