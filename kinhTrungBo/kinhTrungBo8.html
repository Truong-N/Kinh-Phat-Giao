At one time the World-Honored One was at Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika (Anathapindika).
At that time, the Venerable Maha Cunda, in the afternoon, rose from his solitary residence in meditation, went to the Buddha's place, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, Venerable Maha Cunda told the Buddha:
6
272
654
-- World-Honored One, there are these types of views that arise in the world, either related to ego theory or related to world theory.
World-Honored One, for a Bhikkhu who has the intention right from the beginning, is it possible to get rid of those views or not, is it possible to let go of those views or not?
7
413
1067
-- Hey Cunda, these types of views arise in the world, either related to egoism, or related to worldism, - wherever these views are hidden, and where these views are present, there is only one way to observe them as they really are with wisdom:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", then there is the elimination of those views, there is the renunciation of those views.

Hey Cunda, this event happened when here a Bhikkhu who was separated from desire and unwholesome dharma attained and stayed in the first Meditation, a state of joy and happiness born of separation from desire, with the reach of the senses.
He may think:
"I live with reduced conduct."
Cunda, these (results) are not called reductions in the precepts of the Saints.
They are called the present, residing happily in the precepts of the Saints.
10
374
1820
Hey Cunda, this event happened when here, a Bhikkhu destroyed thought and thought, attained and stayed in the second Meditation, a state of joy and happiness born of concentration, without thought or thought, internally aware of one mind.
He may think:
"I live with reduced conduct."
Cunda, these (results) are not called reductions in the precepts of the Saints.
They are called the present, residing happily in the precepts of the Saints.
11
377
2197
Cunda, this event happened when, here, a Bhikkhu abandoned joy and stayed in equanimity, was mindful and alert, and felt the pleasant feeling in his body that the Saints call the stay of equanimity, mindfulness and happiness, and attained and stayed in the third Meditation.

Cunda, these (results) are not called reductions in the precepts of the Saints.
They are called the present, residing happily in the precepts of the Saints.

361

Hey Cunda, I said that the arising of the mind is very beneficial for wholesome dharmas, but what about the body and speech karma in accordance (with the mind).
Therefore, Cunda:
65
95
241
(1) "Others can do harm, we here will not do harm", we need to create such a mind.
66
114
355
(2) "Others can kill, we here will abstain from killing", it is necessary to generate such a mind...
(as above)...
67
39
394
(3-43) "The others...
(as above)...
68
183
577
(44) "Others may be infected with worldliness, stubbornly holding on to opinions, and have a difficult nature to practice equanimity. We here will not be contaminated with worldly things, not stubborn to stubborn opinions, have a nature that is easy to practice equanimity", we need to develop such a mind.

Hey Cunda, just like an uneven road, there is another smooth road as its counterpart.
Hey Cunda, just like an uneven water station, there is another flat water platform to counteract it.
Likewise, Cunda:
71
59
852
(1) For humans who do harm, there is the antidote of non-harming.
72
58
910
(2) For humans who kill, there is an antidote to abstaining from killing.
73
76
986
(3) For people who take what is not given, there is an antidote for giving up taking what is not given.

(Upward direction)

Cunda, for example, all unwholesome dharmas are directed downward, while wholesome dharmas are all directed upward.
Likewise, Cunda:

(1) People who do not harm, look up to those who harm, people who abstain from killing, look up towards those who kill.
79
84

(Dharma of liberation)
83
649

Hey Cunda, a person who has fallen into the mud himself can pull up a person who has fallen into the mud, that cannot happen.
Hey Cunda, people themselves do not fall into the mud, they can pull up a person who has fallen into the mud, that can happen.
Hey Cunda, people themselves cannot subdue, cannot train, cannot completely liberate, but they themselves can subdue, train and completely liberate others, that cannot happen.
A person who is subdued, trained, and completely liberated, can himself subdue, train, and completely liberate others, that can happen.
Likewise, Cunda:
84
144
3909
(1) For those who do harm, not doing harm leads to complete liberation;
For people who kill, abstaining from killing leads to complete liberation.
85

(Conclusion)

2313
Cunda, thus I have preached the Dharma of reduction, I have taught the Dharma of raising the mind, I have taught the Dharma of antidote, I have taught the Dharma of upward direction, I have preached the Dharma of complete liberation.
90
319
2632
Cunda, what the Teacher must do, for happiness, out of compassion for his disciples, I have done these things, out of compassion for you.
Hey Cunda, these are tree stumps, these are impure houses.
Hey Cunda, meditate, don't be careless, don't regret it later.
This is My teaching to you.
91
87
2719
The World-Honored One preached like that.
Venerable Maha Cunda was delighted and accepted the Buddha's teachings.

Một thời Thế Tôn ở Savatthi (Xá-vệ), tại Jetavana (Kỳ-đà Lâm), vườn ông Anathapindika (Cấp Cô Ðộc).
Lúc bấy giờ, Tôn giả Maha Cunda, vào buổi chiều từ chỗ độc cư Thiền tịnh đứng dậy, đến tại chỗ Thế Tôn, đảnh lễ Ngài rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, Tôn giả Maha Cunda bạch Thế Tôn:
6
272
654
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có những loại sở kiến này khởi lên trên đời, hoặc liên hệ đến ngã luận, hoặc liên hệ đến thế giới luận.
Bạch Thế Tôn, đối với một Tỷ-kheo, có tác ý ngay từ ban đầu, thời có thể đoạn trừ những sở kiến ấy hay không, có thể xả ly những sở kiến ấy hay không?
7
413
1067
-- Này Cunda, những loại sở kiến này khởi lên trên đời, hoặc liên hệ đến ngã luận, hoặc liên hệ đến thế giới luận, - chỗ nào những sở kiến này tiềm ẩn, và chỗ nào những sở kiến này hiện hành, chỉ có cách như thật quán sát chúng với trí tuệ rằng:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", có vậy thời có sự đoạn trừ những sở kiến ấy, có sự xả ly những sở kiến ấy.

Này Cunda, sự kiện này xảy ra khi ở đây một Tỷ-kheo ly dục, ly bất thiện pháp, chứng và trú Thiền thứ nhất, một trạng thái hỷ lạc do ly dục sanh, với tầm với tứ.
Vị ấy có thể nghĩ:
"Ta sống với hạnh đoạn giảm".
Này Cunda, các (quả chứng) ấy không gọi là đoạn giảm trong giới luật của bậc Thánh.
