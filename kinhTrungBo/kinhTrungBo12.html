The Great Lion's Roar Sutta
3
20
70
(Mahàsìhanàda sutta)
4
17
87
Thus I heard.
5
92
179
At one time the Blessed One was residing in Vesali, outside the city, in a forest to the west.
6
424
603
At that time, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavi tribe, having just renounced this Dharma and Vinaya, spoke the following words in the assembly in Vesali:
"The ascetic Gotama has no supreme Dharma, no superior knowledge worthy of a Saint;
The ascetic Gotama preaches a Dharma that he himself created, based on reasoning, according to testing, and preached for a specific goal, capable of leading to higher states, capable of guiding practitioners to the cessation of suffering."
7
499
1102 
At that time, Venerable Sariputta, in the morning, put on his robe, took his alms bowl, and entered the city of Vesali to beg for alms. 
The Venerable Sariputta heard Sunakkhatta of the Licchavi tribe say the following in the assembly at Vesali:
"The ascetic Gotama has no superior Dharma, no supreme knowledge worthy of a Saint;
The ascetic Gotama preaches a Dharma that he himself created, based on reasoning, according to testing and preached for a specific goal, capable of leading to higher states, capable of guiding practitioners to the cessation of suffering."
8
199
1301
Then the Venerable Sariputta, having finished his alms-gathering, returned to the Buddha's dwelling place, paid homage to Him, and sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, Venerable Sariputta addressed the Buddha:
9
207
1508
-- Venerable Lord, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavi tribe, having just abandoned this Dharma and Vinaya, said the following in the assembly of Vesali:
"The ascetic Gotama has no superior Dharma...
(as above)...
the cessation of suffering."
10
347
1855
-- Sariputta, Sunakkhatta was angry and foolish; out of anger he spoke those words.
Sariputta, he thought:
"I will speak ill of him."
Yet the foolish Sunakkhatta praised the Tathagata.
Sariputta, who would praise the Tathagata in this way:
"That Dharma is taught for a special purpose, capable of guiding practitioners to the cessation of suffering."
11
238
2093
"Now, Sariputta, for that foolish Sunakkhatta, there will be no such thing as:
"This is the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened One, endowed with perfect knowledge and conduct, the Well-Gone One, the Knower of the World, the Supreme Being, the Tamer of Men, the Teacher of Gods and Men, the Buddha, the Blessed One."
12
765
2858
"Sariputta, to that foolish Sunakkhatta, there will be no such claim about me as follows:
"This is the Blessed One, who has attained various supernatural powers, manifesting many bodies in one body, and many bodies in one body, appearing and disappearing, passing through walls, through cities, through mountains as if passing through empty space, emerging from the earth as if in water, walking on water without sinking as if on land, sitting cross-legged and walking in the air like a bird;
with his hands, touching and feeling the moon and the sun, objects of great power and great divine might, able to fly to the Brahma realm by himself."
"Sariputta, to that foolish Sunakkhatta, there will be no such claim about me as follows:
"This is the Blessed One with superhuman pure divine hearing who can hear both the sounds of gods and humans, near and far." 
13
536
3394
"Now, Sariputta, there will be no such thing as the following concerning me for that foolish Sunakkhatta:
"This is the Blessed One, having delved deeply into the minds of beings, the minds of men, and his own mind, he knows as follows:
"The mind that has greed knows that the mind has greed.
" "The mind that is not greedy knows that the mind that is not greedy...
The mind that is focused...
The mind that is distracted...
The mind that is great in action...
The mind that is not great in action...
The mind that is not yet supreme...
The mind that is supreme...
The mind that is meditative...
The mind that is not meditative...
The mind that is liberated...
The mind that is not liberated knows that the mind that is not liberated."
He knows thus.

(The Ten Powers of the Tathagata)
15
213
3629
"O Sariputta, the Tathagata possesses the ten powers of the Tathagata. It is by accomplishing these ten powers that the Tathagata claims for himself the position of the Bull King, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and turns the Brahma wheel.
What are the ten?
16
352
3981
(1) Here, O Sariputta, the Tathagata truly knows that place is place, and non-place is non-place (the power of knowing that place is non-place).
O Sariputta, the Tathagata truly knows that place is place, and non-place is Beyond this realm.
This is the Tathagata's power.
It is through this Tathagata power that the Tathagata claims for himself the position of the Bull King, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and turns the Wheel of Dharma.
17
250
250
(2) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands the karmic consequences depending on the cause and effect of past, future, and present actions (Knowledge of the power of karmic retribution in the three times). Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands...
(as above)...
and turns the wheel of Brahma.
18
198
448
(3) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands the path leading to all realms (Knowledge of the power of the all-encompassing path).
Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands...
(as above)...
and turns the wheel of Brahma.
19
231
679
(4) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands the world with all realms, many kinds, many differences (Knowledge of the various natures of the world).
Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands...
(as above)...
and turns the wheel of Brahma. 
20
201
880
(5) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands the differing aspirations of all kinds of beings (knowing the power of desire in other beings).
Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands...
turning the wheel of Brahma.
21
231
1111
(6) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands the superior and inferior faculties of all kinds of beings, humankind (knowing the superior and inferior faculties of other beings).
Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands...
(as above)...
and turning the wheel of Brahma.
22
259
1370
(7) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands the defilement, purity, and arising of the meditations, the attainment of meditation, liberation, and concentration (knowing the power of the meditations).
"Now, Sariputta, the Tathagata truly knows...
(as above)...
and turns the Brahma wheel.
23
844
2214
(8) Again, Sariputta, the Tathagata remembers past lives, such as one life, two lives, three lives, four lives, five lives, ten lives, twenty lives, thirty lives, forty lives, fifty lives, one hundred lives, one thousand lives, one hundred thousand lives, many destruction eons, many formation eons, many formation and destruction eons.
He remembers that:
"In that place, I had such a name, such a family, such a caste, experienced such suffering and pleasure, and lived to such an age.
After dying in that place, I was born in that place.
In that place, I had such a name, such a family, such a caste, experienced such suffering and pleasure, and lived to such an age.
After dying in that place, I was born here."
Thus, the Tathagata remembers many past lives along with their general outlines and details.
Sariputta, the Tathagata truly knows...
(as above)...
and turns the Brahma wheel.
24
1041
3255
(9) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata, with pure, superhuman divine eye, sees the life and death of beings.
The Tathagata clearly knows that beings, whether lowly or noble, beautiful or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate, are all due to their actions and karma.
These beings perform evil deeds of body, speech, and mind, slander the Noble Ones, follow wrong views, and create karma according to wrong views.
These people, after their bodies perish and their lives end, are reborn in evil realms, evil beasts, places of suffering, and hell.
These beings perform good deeds of body, speech, and mind, do not slander the Noble Ones, follow right views, and create karma according to right views.
These people, after their physical bodies perish and their lives end, are reborn in good realms, in the heavenly realms, in this world.
Thus, the Tathagata, with his pure, superhuman divine eye, sees the life and death of beings.
The Tathagata understands that beings, whether lowly or noble, beautiful or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate, are all subject to their karma.
Sariputta, the Tathagata truly understands...
(as above)...
and turns the Brahma wheel.
25
473
3728
(10) Furthermore, Sariputta, the Tathagata, by eradicating the defilements, himself realizes, attains, and abides in the present moment in the undefiled state of mind liberation and wisdom liberation.
Sariputta, the Tathagata, by eradicating the defilements, himself with supreme wisdom realizes, attains, and abides in the present moment in the undefiled state of mind liberation and wisdom liberation.
It is through this Tathagata-power that the Tathagata claims for himself the position of Bull King, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and turns the Wheel of Dharma.
26
192
3920
O Sariputta, the Tathagata possesses the ten Tathagata-powers.
It is through the attainment of these ten powers that the Tathagata claims for himself the position of Bull King, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies, and turns the Wheel of Dharma.
27
896
896
"Now, Sariputta, if anyone knows me in this way, sees me in this way, and still says:
"The ascetic Gotama has no superior Dharma, no supreme knowledge worthy of a Saint.
The ascetic Gotama preaches a Dharma that he himself created, based on reasoning, according to testing, preached for a specific goal, capable of leading to higher states, capable of guiding practitioners to the cessation of suffering."
"Now, Sariputta, if that person does not abandon such words;
does not abandon such a mind, does not eradicate such wrong views;
that person will fall into hell like a burden cast aside.
Now, Sariputta, just as a monk who has attained morality, attained meditation, and attained wisdom can attain true knowledge in the present moment.
Now, Sariputta, I say that is such attainment.
If that person does not abandon such words, does not abandon such a mind, does not eradicate such wrong views; 
That person will fall into hell like a burden cast aside.
28
19
915
(Four Fearless Principles)
29
197
1112
Sariputta, there are four fearless principles. By achieving these four principles, the Tathagata claims for himself the position of the Bull King, roars like a lion in the assemblies, and turns the Wheel of Brahma.
What are the four?
30
359
1471 
Sariputta, I see no reason why a monk, a Brahmin, a god, a demon, a Brahma, or anyone in the world could rightly criticize me by saying:
"These principles have not been fully realized, yet you claim to have fully realized them."
Sariputta, because I see no reason for such a thing, I live in peace, without fear, without fear.
31
203
1674
Sariputta, I see no reason...
to rightly criticize me, saying:
"These defilements have not been eradicated, yet you claim to have eradicated them."
Sariputta, for I do not see...
attaining fearlessness.
32
248
1922 
Sariputta, I see no reason...
to rightly criticize me, saying:
"These practices are called obstacles when, in practice, there is nothing called an obstacle."
Sariputta, for I do not see...
attaining fearlessness.
33
419
2341
Sariputta, I see no reason why a Brahmin, a god, a demon, a Brahma, or anyone in the world could rightly criticize me, saying:
"The Dharma you preach does not lead to a specific goal, it has no potential for enlightenment, it cannot lead practitioners to the cessation of suffering."
Sariputta, because I see no such reason, I live in peace, without fear, without fearlessness.
34
181
2522 
Sariputta, there are four fearless qualities; it is by achieving these four qualities that the Tathagata claims for himself the position of the Bull King, roars like a lion in the assemblies, and turns the Wheel of Brahma.
35
112
2634 
Sariputta, if anyone knows me in this way...
that person will fall into hell like a burden cast aside.
36
15
2649
(Eight Assemblies)
37
343
2992
Sariputta, there are these eight assemblies:
The Kshatriya Assembly, the Brahmin Assembly, the Householder Assembly, the Ascetic Assembly, the Assembly of the Four Heavenly Kings, the Assembly of the Thirty-Three Devas, the Mara Assembly, the Brahma Assembly.
Sariputta, there are these eight assemblies.
Sariputta, the Tathagata thus attained the four fearless qualities, approaching and entering these eight assemblies.
38
390
3382
Sariputta, I recall that I have been to hundreds of Kshatriya assemblies.
However, before I sat down there, before I spoke and before I conversed;
Sariputta, I saw no reason to think:
"Surely fear and trembling will come to haunt me."
"Now, Sariputta, because I see no reason for that, I live in peace, without fear, without fearlessness.
39
558
3940
Now, Sariputta, I remember that I have been to hundreds of assemblies of Brahmins...
(as above)...
Assemblies of householders...
Assemblies of ascetics...
Assemblies of the Four Heavenly Kings...
Assemblies of the Thirty-Three Devas...
Assemblies of Maras...
Assemblies of Brahmas.
However, before I sat down there, before I spoke and before I discussed, Sariputta, I saw no reason to think:
"Surely fear and trembling will come to haunt me."
Now, Sariputta, because I see no reason for that, I live in peace, without fearlessness, without fearlessness.
40
113
4053
Sariputta, if anyone knows Me in this way...
that person will fall into hell, like a burden thrown aside.
41
15
4068
(Four Types of Birth)
42
93
4161
Sariputta, there are four types of birth.
What are the four?
Oviparous birth, viviparous birth, moisture-borne birth, and transformation-borne birth.
43
696
696
Sariputta, what is oviparous birth?
Sariputta, those beings that break through the eggshell and are born, Sariputta, that is called oviparous birth.
And Sariputta, what is viviparous birth?
Sariputta, those beings that break through the thin membrane covering the private parts and are born, Sariputta, that is called viviparous birth.
And Sariputta, what is damp birth?
Sariputta, those beings that are born from rotten fish, from rotten corpses, from rotten porridge, or from dirty lakes or filthy ponds.
Sariputta, that is called damp birth.
And Sariputta, what is spontaneous birth?
Devas, beings in hell, some of the human race, and some of the lower realms.
Sariputta, that is called spontaneous birth.
44
154
850
Sariputta, there are four kinds of rebirths.
Sariputta, if anyone knows me in this way...
that person will fall into hell, like a burden thrown aside.
45
26
876
(Five Realms of Rebirth and Nirvana)
46
111
987
Sariputta, there are five kinds of rebirths.
What are the five?
Hell, animals, hungry ghosts, humans, gods.
47
225
1212
(1) Sariputta, I know hell, the path to hell, and the way to hell.
Depending on one's actions and karma, after the body perishes and life ends, one must be reborn into evil realms, evil realms, places of suffering, hell; I also know this.
48
208
1420
(2) And, Sariputta, I understand the animal realm, the path leading to the animal realm, and the way of life leading to the animal realm.
Depending on one's actions, after the body perishes and life ends, one must be reborn into the animal realm; I also understand this.
49
200
1620
(3) And, Sariputta, I understand the hungry ghost realm, the path leading to the hungry ghost realm, and the way of life leading to the hungry ghost realm.
Depending on one's actions, after the body perishes and life ends, one must be reborn into the hungry ghost realm; I also understand this.
50
230
1850
(4) And, Sariputta, I also understand the human realm, the path leading to the human world, and the way of life leading to the human world.
Depending on one's actions, after the body perishes and life ends, one must be reborn into the human realm; I also understand this.
51
236
2086
(5) And, Sariputta, I also know the gods, the path leading to the gods, and the way leading to the gods.
Depending on one's actions, after the body perishes and life ends, one is born into a good realm, the gods, this world, this matter, I also know.
52
299
2385
And, Sariputta, I also know Nirvana, the path leading to Nirvana, and the way leading to Nirvana.
Depending on one's actions, by eradicating the defilements, after oneself with superior wisdom, realizing, attaining, and abiding in the present moment in the undefiled mind liberation, wisdom liberation, this matter, I also know.
53
1432
3817
(1) Sariputta, here, with my mind, I know the minds of some people.
Because of this person's actions, gestures, and path taken, after death, they will be reborn in a bad realm, a place of evil, a place of suffering, a hellish place.
After some time, with my pure, superhuman divine eye, I saw that after death, they would be reborn in a bad realm, a place of evil, a place of suffering, a hellish place, and would experience extreme suffering, pain, and torment.
Sariputta, it is like a pit of burning coals deeper than a person's body, overflowing with glowing coals, without flames or smoke, and a person approaches it, overwhelmed by the heat, tormented by the heat, exhausted, with a dry throat, bitter taste in their mouth, thirsty, and walking straight to that pit of coals by a single path.
A person with eyes who sees that person might say:
"Because of this person's actions, gestures, and path taken, they will reach that pit of coals."
After some time, that person will see the other person fall into that pit of coals and have to endure extreme suffering, agony, and torment.
Sariputta, similarly, here, with my mind, I know the minds of some people:
"This person's actions are such, their manners are such, their path is such, after the body perishes and life ends, they will be reborn into such a bad realm, a place of evil beasts, a place of suffering, hell."
After some time, with my pure, superhuman divine eye, I see that after the body perishes and life ends, that person will be reborn into such a bad realm, a place of evil beasts, a place of suffering, hell, and have to endure extreme suffering, agony, and torment.
54
979
979
(2) Now, Sariputta, here with my mind, I know the minds of some people:
"This person's actions are like this, his manners are like this, his path is like this, after the body perishes and life ends, he will be reborn as an animal."
After a time, with my pure, superhuman divine eye, I see that after the body perishes and life ends, he will be reborn as an animal, and will experience extreme suffering, pain, and intense suffering.
Now, Sariputta, it is as if there is a cesspool, deeper than a person's body, full of excrement, and a person comes to it, overwhelmed by the heat, tormented by the heat, tired, with a dry throat, bitter taste in his mouth, thirsty, and goes straight to that cesspool by just one path.
A person with eyes who sees that person can say:
"This person's actions are like this, his manners are like this, and his path is like this, he will go to that cesspool." 
After some time, that person will see the other person fall into that cesspit and have to experience extreme, agonizing, and intense feelings.
Sariputta, likewise, here with my mind...
(as above)...
suffering, intense.
55
877
1856
(3) Sariputta, here with my mind, I know the mind of some people: "This person's actions are like this, his manners are like this...
after the body perishes and life ends, he will be reborn as a hungry ghost and have to experience extreme, agonizing, and intense feelings."
Sariputta, just as there is a tree growing on uneven ground, with sparse leaves, with sparse patches of shade.
And a person comes along, overwhelmed by the heat, tormented by the heat, tired, with a dry throat, bitter taste in his mouth, thirsty, and goes straight to that tree by only one path.
A person with eyes can see that person and say:
"This person's actions are like this, their manners are like this, and they walk the path in this way, and they will reach that tree."
After a while, that person will see the other person sitting or lying under the shade of that tree and experiencing intense suffering, pain, and agony.
Sariputta, likewise, here with my mind...
(as above)...
suffering, agony.
56
890
2746
(4) Sariputta, here with my mind, I know the mind of some people:
"This person's actions are like this, their manners are like this...
after the body perishes and life ends, they will be reborn as a human."
After a while...
I see that person reborn as a human, and experiencing many pleasant sensations.
Sariputta, just as there is a tree living on a flat piece of land with lush leaves and dense shade.
And a person comes, overwhelmed by the heat, tormented by the heat, tired, with a dry throat, bitter taste in their mouth, thirsty, and goes straight to that tree by a single path.
A person with eyes who sees that person can say:
"This person's actions are like this, this person's gestures are like this, and they enter the path in this way, and they will reach that tree."
After a while, that person will see the other person, sitting or lying under the shade of that tree and experiencing many pleasant sensations.
Sariputta, likewise, here, with my mind...
...experiencing many pleasant sensations.
57
1186
3932
(5) Sariputta, here with my mind, I know the minds of some people:
"This person's actions are like this, their gestures are like this...
after the body perishes and life ends, they will be reborn in a good realm, the heavenly realm, this world."
After some time...
We see that person being born into a good realm, the heavenly realm, this world, and experiencing blissful sensations.
Sariputta, it is like a building with a pointed roof, plastered both inside and out, sheltered from the wind, with bolts and closed windows.
There is a bed, covered with long feather mattresses, white mattresses, cotton mattresses embroidered with flowers, mattresses made of goatskin called kadali, with a mattress with a frame hanging above, and long red pillows at both ends.
And a person comes, overwhelmed by the heat, tormented by the heat, tired, with a dry throat, bitter taste in their mouth, thirsty, and goes straight to that building.
A person with eyes who sees that person might say:
"This person's actions, their manners, and their path taken will lead them to that building."
After some time, that person will see the other person sitting or lying in that pavilion, in that upper room, on that platform, and experiencing many blissful sensations.
Sariputta, likewise, here with my mind...
one experiences many pleasant sensations.
58
1706
1706
(6) Sariputta, here with my mind, I know the mind of some people:
"This person's actions are such, his manners are such, his path is such, he will eradicate the defilements, and by himself with supreme wisdom he will realize, attain, and abide in the present moment in such undefiled liberation of mind and liberation of wisdom."
After a time, I see that he eradicates the defilements, by himself with supreme wisdom he will realize, attain, and abide in the present moment in such undefiled liberation of mind and liberation of wisdom, experiencing feelings of supreme bliss.
Sariputta, it is like a lotus pond with clear water, sweet water, cool water, bright water, a well-arranged and beautiful pond bank, and not far from that pond is a dense forest.
A person comes, overwhelmed by the heat, tormented by the heat, tired, with a dry throat, bitter taste, thirsty, and goes straight to that lotus pond.
A person with discerning eyes might say:
"This person's actions, manner of conduct, and path taken in this way will lead them to that lotus pond."
After some time, that person will see the other person, after immersing themselves in that lotus pond, after bathing, drinking the water, and relieving all worries, fatigue, and afflictions, after leaving the pond, immediately sitting or lying down in that dense forest and experiencing blissful sensations.
Similarly, Sariputta, here, with my mind, I perceive the minds of some people:
"This person's actions, manner of conduct, and path taken in this way will eradicate defilements, and with superior wisdom, they will attain, realize, and abide in the present moment in a state of undefiled liberation of mind and liberation of wisdom."
After some time, I saw that he eradicated the defilements, attained enlightenment by himself with supreme wisdom, realized and abided in the present moment in the undefiled state of mind liberation, wisdom liberation, and experienced blissful sensations.
59
825
2531
"Sariputta, these five kinds are the five realms of rebirth.
Sariputta, if someone knows me in this way, sees me in this way, and says:
"The ascetic Gotama has no superior Dharma, no supreme knowledge worthy of a noble person.
The ascetic Gotama preaches a Dharma that he himself created, based on reasoning and subject to testing."
Sariputta, if that person does not abandon that speech, does not abandon that mind, does not eradicate that wrong view, then that person will fall into hell like a burden thrown aside.
Sariputta, a monk who has perfected morality, perfected meditation, and perfected wisdom can attain right knowledge in the present moment.
"Sariputta, I say that this is the attainment.
If that person does not abandon that speech, does not abandon that mind, does not eradicate that wrong view, then that person will fall into hell like a burden cast aside.
60
21
2552
(The Asceticism of the Bodhisattva)
61
183
2735
Sariputta, I have perfect knowledge of the holy life, possessing four virtues:
Regarding asceticism, I am the foremost in asceticism;
Regarding poverty, I am the foremost in poverty;
Regarding renunciation, I am the foremost in renunciation;
Regarding solitude, I am the foremost in solitude."
62
2308

Sariputta, here is my asceticism:
I live naked, unrestrained, without following any rules, I lick my hands clean, I do not step forward when begging for alms, I do not accept food brought to me, I do not accept food specially cooked for me, I do not accept invitations to eat, I do not accept food from pots and pans, I do not accept food at the doorstep, I do not accept food placed between sticks, I do not accept food placed between mortars, I do not accept food from two people eating together, I do not accept food from a pregnant woman, I do not accept food from a woman breastfeeding, I do not accept food from a woman having intercourse, I do not accept donated food, I do not accept food where dogs stand, I do not accept food where flies swarm, I do not eat fish, I do not eat meat, I do not drink distilled liquor, or fermented liquor.
I only accept food from one house, only one bite; or from two houses, only two bites; or from seven houses, only seven bites.
I sustain myself with only one bowl, only two bowls, only seven bowls.
I eat only one meal a day, one meal every two days, one meal every seven days.
Thus, I live according to the practice of moderation in eating and drinking, eating only once every half a month.
I only eat grass and rice to survive, brown rice, mustard seeds, scraps of animal hide, chaff, rice flour, sesame flour, grass, cow dung, fruit, roots from the forest, and fallen fruit to survive.
I wear coarse linen, coarse linen mixed with other fabrics, burial cloth that is then discarded, robes made of powdered straw, robes made of tititaka bark, robes made of black goatskin, robes woven from pieces of black goatskin, robes made of auspicious grass, robes made of tree bark, robes made of small pieces of wood, robes made of braided hair, robes made of braided horsehair, robes made of owl feathers.
I live by plucking my hair, I follow the custom of plucking my hair, I follow the practice of always standing and not using a seat, I am a person who sits with my legs spread apart, I live diligently according to the practice of sitting with my legs spread apart.
I use thorns to make a bed, I often sleep on a bed of thorns, I live using wooden planks as a bed, I live lying on the bare ground, I often sleep on one side, I live letting dust and dirt cling to my body, I live and sleep outdoors, following the practice of lying wherever I am, I live eating unclean things, I live not drinking cold water, following the practice of not drinking cold water, I live bathing three times a night, following the practice of bathing in water.
Thus I live according to the ascetic practice of tormenting and afflicting my body in many ways.
Sariputta, this is my asceticism.
63

2883
Sariputta, here is my asceticism:
On my body, dust accumulates over many years, forming sheets and pieces.
Like the base of a tinduka tree, dust accumulates over many years, forming sheets and pieces;
so, Sariputta, on my body dust accumulates over many years, forming sheets and pieces.
Sariputta, I do not think:
"With my own hands, I will brush away this dust, or others with their hands will brush away this dust for me."
Sariputta, I do not think like that.
Sariputta, this is my asceticism.
64
289
3172
Sariputta, this is my renunciation.
Sariputta, mindful, I go forward;
mindfully I go backward, I dwell in loving-kindness even in a drop of water with the thought:
"May I not harm even the smallest being in their evil realms!" Sariputta, this is my renunciation.
65
1007
4179
Sariputta, this is my solitude.
Sariputta, I go deep into a forest and dwell there.
When I see a cowherd, a shepherd, a grass cutter, a woodcutter, or a lumberjack, I run from one forest to another, from one grove to another, from one valley to another, from one hill to another.
Why is that?
I thought to myself:
"May they not see me, and may I not see them!" Sariputta, just as a wild animal, upon seeing a person, runs from one forest to another, from one grove to another, from one valley to another, from one hill to another.
Similarly, Sariputta, when I see a cowherd, a shepherd, a grass cutter, a woodcutter, or a woodcutter, I run from one forest to another, from one grove to another, from one valley to another, from one hill to another.
Why?
I thought to myself:
"May they not see me, and may I not see them!" Sariputta, this is my practice of solitude.
66
321
321
Sariputta, then I crawled on all fours to the cowsheds, when the cows had gone, when the cowherds were not present, and I ate the dung of the calves, the young calves, the suckling calves.
As long as my urine and dung remained, I sustained myself with them.
Sariputta, this was my great impure eating.
67
601
922 
Sariputta, I went deep into a terrifyingly dense forest and settled there.
Sariputta, in this terrifyingly dense forest, whoever still had greed entered that dense forest, their hair stood on end.
Sariputta, then I lived in the open air on cold winter nights, on the eighth day of the month, when it snowed, on such nights I lived in the open air, and during the day I lived in the dense forest.
We lived in the last days of summer, living under the open sky during the day and in the dense forest at night.
Then, Sariputta, these wondrous verses, never before heard, arose:
68
31
953
Now, scorched and freezing,
69
34
987
Living alone in the terrifying forest,
70
34
1021
Naked, I sat without warmth,
71
32
1053
A hermit, in contemplative thought.
72
303
1356
Sariputta, I lay sleeping in a graveyard, resting on a skeleton.
Sariputta, shepherds came near me, spat on me, urinated on me, sprinkled dust on me, and poked sticks in my ears.
Sariputta, and I knew I had no ill will toward them.
"This, Sariputta, is my practice of equanimity."
73
1716
3072
"Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who have the following doctrines and interpretations:
"Purity is achieved through food."
They say:
"We live by apples," and they eat apples, they eat apple pulp, they drink apple juice in various forms.
"Sariputta, I claim to live by eating only one apple."
"Sariputta, perhaps you think:
"The apples of that time were huge."
"Sariputta, do not understand it that way.
For the apples of that time were similar to the apples of today."
"Sariputta, while I lived by eating only one apple, my body became extremely weak.
Because I ate so little, my hands and feet became like withered blades of grass or dried-up vine stems."
Because I ate so little, my buttocks became like the hooves of a camel.
Because I ate so little, my exposed spines resembled a string of balls.
Because I ate so little, my thin ribs were like the rotten rafters of a stilt house.
Because I ate so little, my pupils, once glistening, lay deep within my eye sockets, like the shimmering water deep within a deep well.
Because I ate so little, my scalp became wrinkled and dry like a bitter white squash cut before ripening, wrinkled and dried by the hot wind.
Sariputta, if I thought,
"Let me touch my belly skin," it was my spine that I grasped.
If I thought,
"Let me touch my spine," it was my belly skin that I grasped.
Because I ate so little, Sariputta, my belly skin clung tightly to my spine.
"Now, Sariputta, if I think, 
'I need to defecate or urinate,' I will fall down, face to face, because I have eaten too little.
Now, Sariputta, if I want to soothe my body, to massage my limbs with my hands, then, Sariputta, while I am massaging my limbs with my hands, the hairs on my body will wither and fall out, because I have eaten too little."
74
1839
1839
Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following doctrines and interpretations:
"Purity is achieved through food."
They say:
"We live on mung beans...
(as above)...
we live on sesame seeds...
(as above)...
we live on rice," and they eat rice, they eat rice ground into flour, they drink rice water, and they eat rice in many forms.
Sariputta, I claim that I live on only one grain of rice.
Sariputta, you may think:
"The rice grain at that time was large."
Sariputta, do not understand it that way.
For the rice grain at that time was similar to the rice grain today.
Sariputta, while I lived on only one grain of rice, my body became extremely weak.
Because I ate so little, my hands and feet became like withered blades of grass or dried-up vine stalks.
Because I ate so little, my buttocks became like the hooves of a camel.
Because I ate so little, my exposed spine resembled a string of balls.
Because I ate so little, my thin ribs were like the rafters of a dilapidated stilt house.
Because I ate so little, my sparkling pupils lay deep within their sockets, like the shimmering water deep within a deep well.
Because I ate so little, my scalp became wrinkled and dry like a bitter white squash cut before ripening, wrinkled and dried by the hot wind.
Sariputta, if I thought,
"Let me touch my belly skin," then it was my spine that I grasped.
If I thought,
"Let me touch my spine," then it was my belly skin that I grasped.
Because I eat so little, Sariputta, my abdominal skin clings to my spine.
Sariputta, if I think,
"I need to defecate or urinate," I collapse, falling face down on the ground, because I eat so little.
Sariputta, if I want to soothe my body, massaging my limbs with my hands, then, Sariputta, while I am massaging my limbs, the decaying hairs fall from my body, because I eat so little.
75
409
2248
Sariputta, even if I follow such gestures, such conduct, such asceticism, I will not attain the supreme qualities, nor the superior knowledge worthy of a Saint.
Why is that?
Because with such means, one cannot attain the supreme qualities with noble wisdom.
This noble wisdom, attained by a Saint, is capable of upward progress and can lead practitioners to the cessation of suffering.
76
395
2643
Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following doctrines and views:
"Purity is attained through samsara."
Sariputta, it is not easy to find samsara that I did not experience for a considerable period of time, except with the Suddhavasas.
Sariputta, if I had been reborn in the Suddhavasas, I would not have returned to this world.
77
386
3029 
Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following doctrines and views:
"Purity is attained through arising."
Sariputta, it is not easy to find arising that I did not experience for a considerable period of time, except with the Suddhavasas.
"Now, Sariputta, if I had been born in the Pure Abode heaven, I would not have returned to this world again."
78
377
3406
Now, Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following doctrines and views:
"Purity is attained through abiding."
Now, Sariputta, it is not easy to find the abiding that I did not experience for a considerable period of time, except with the Pure Abode heavens.
Now, Sariputta, if I had abiding in the Pure Abode heaven, I would not have returned to this world again.
79
328
3734
Now, Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following doctrines and views:
"Purity is attained through sacrifice."
"Now, Sariputta, it is not easy to find the kind of sacrifice that I did not perform for quite a long time, when I was a Kshatriya king who performed the consecration ceremony, or a wealthy Brahmin.
80
332
4066
Now, Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following doctrines and views:
"Purity is attained through fire worship."
Now, Sariputta, it is not easy to find the kind of fire worship that I did not perform for quite a long time, when I was a Kshatriya king who performed the consecration ceremony, or a wealthy Brahmin.
81
1875
1875
"Now, Sariputta, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who hold the following views, who have the following understanding:
"When a young man is still young, with jet-black hair and full of vitality, in the prime of his youth, he attains supreme wisdom and eloquence.
But when he is old, advanced in age, has reached the end of his life, when he is eighty, ninety, or one hundred years old, then that supreme wisdom and eloquence is extinguished."
"Now, Sariputta, do not hold such a view.
Now, Sariputta, I am old, advanced in age, have reached the end of my life, I am now eighty years old.
Now, Sariputta, here I have four disciples, who lived to be one hundred years old, who attained the highest level of mindfulness, the highest level of concentration, the highest level of diligence, and possessed the highest wisdom and eloquence."
"Now, Sariputta, just as a skilled archer, trained and adept, can easily shoot a light arrow through the shadow of a palm tree, with a light arrow.
Similarly, those with such supreme mindfulness, who attain such supreme wisdom and eloquence, if they repeatedly ask me a question about the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and if I, being asked repeatedly, explain it to them, and if they, having received such an explanation, understand it as explained, and if they do not ask me about related matters and other issues, except for eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, defecating, urinating, or sleeping to regain strength."
"Sariputta, even so, the Tathagata's discourse is not yet complete, the Tathagata's explanation of the syntax is not yet complete, the Tathagata's answers to questions are not yet complete, when four of my disciples, who lived to be one hundred years old, lived to be one hundred years old, and passed away after one hundred years.
Sariputta, even if you were to carry me on your bed from place to place, the Tathagata's wisdom and eloquence would not change."
82
500
2375
Sariputta, those who speak truthfully will say the following:
"A sentient being, not controlled by delusion, was born into the world for the benefit and happiness of sentient beings, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, happiness, and peace of gods and humans."
He will speak of me truthfully as follows:
"A sentient being, not controlled by delusion, has been born into the world for the benefit and happiness of sentient beings, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, happiness, and peace of gods and humans."
83

At that time, Venerable Nagasamala stood behind the Buddha and fanned him!
Venerable Nagasamala said to the Buddha:
84
164
2643
-- How wonderful, Venerable Lord!
How rare, Venerable Lord!
After hearing this teaching, my hair stands on end.
Venerable Lord, what is the name of this teaching?
85
103
2746
-- Nagasamala, therefore this teaching is called the "Teaching of Hair Standing on End."
You should uphold it in this way.
86
8
2833
The Buddha taught thus.
Venerable Nagasamala rejoiced and accepted the Buddha's teachings with faith.

Như vầy tôi nghe.

179
Một thời Thế Tôn trú tại Vesali (Tỳ-xá-ly), ở phía ngoài thành, trong một khu rừng phía Tây.
6
424
603
Lúc bấy giờ, Sunakkhatta thuộc bộ lạc Licchavi, vừa mới từ bỏ Pháp và Luật này, nói lời nói như sau trong Hội chúng ở Vesali:
"Sa-môn Gotama không có pháp thượng nhân, không có tri kiến thù thắng xứng đáng bậc Thánh;
Sa-môn Gotama thuyết pháp, pháp ấy tự mình tạo ra, do suy luận tác thành, tùy thuận trắc nghiệm, và thuyết cho một mục tiêu đặc biệt, có khả năng hướng thượng, có thể dẫn người thực hành diệt tận khổ đau".
7
499
1102
Lúc ấy Tôn giả Sariputta (Xá-lợi-phất) vào buổi sáng, đắp y, cầm bát, vào thành Vesali để khất thực.
Tôn giả Sariputta nghe Sunakkhatta thuộc bộ lạc Licchavi nói như sau trong hội chúng ở Vesali:
"Sa-môn Gotama không có pháp thượng nhân, không có tri kiến thù thắng xứng đáng bậc Thánh;
Sa-môn Gotama thuyết pháp, pháp ấy tự mình tạo ra, do suy luận tác thành, tùy thuận trắc nghiệm và thuyết pháp cho một mục tiêu đặc biệt, có khả năng hướng thượng, có thể dẫn người thực hành diệt tận khổ đau".
8
199
1301
Rồi Tôn giả Sariputta khất thực xong, sau khi ăn và đi khất thực trở về đến chỗ ở Thế Tôn, sau khi đến đảnh lễ Ngài và ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, Tôn giả Sariputta bạch Thế Tôn:
9
207
1508
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, Sunakkhatta thuộc bộ lạc Licchavi, vừa mới từ bỏ Pháp và Luật này, nói lời nói như sau trong hội chúng Vesali:
"Sa-môn Gotama không có pháp thượng nhân...
(như trên)...
diệt tận khổ đau".
10
347
1855
-- Này Sariputta, Sunakkhatta phẫn nộ và ngu si, do phẫn nộ nên nói lên lời ấy.
Này Sariputta, Ông ta nghĩ:
"Ta sẽ nói xấu".
Thế mà kẻ ngu Sunakkhatta lại nói lời tán thán Như Lai.
Này Sariputta, ai nói như sau là tán thán Như Lai:
"Pháp ấy được thuyết giảng cho một mục tiêu đặc biệt, có khả năng hướng dẫn người thực hành diệt tận khổ đau".
11
238
2093
Này Sariputta, đối với Sunakkhatta ngu si kia, sẽ không có tùy pháp nào về Ta như sau:
"Ðây là Như Lai, A-la-hán, Chánh Ðẳng Giác, Minh Hạnh Túc, Thiện Thệ, Thế Gian Giải, Vô Thượng Sĩ, Ðiều Ngự Trượng Phu, Thiên Nhân Sư, Phật, Thế Tôn".
12
765
2858
Này Sariputta, đối với Sunakkhatta ngu si kia, sẽ không có tùy pháp nào về Ta như sau:
"Ðây là Thế Tôn, vị đã chứng được các loại thần thông, một thân hiện ra nhiều thân, nhiều thân hiện ra một thân, hiện hình, biến hình, đi ngang qua vách, qua thành, qua núi, như đi ngang hư không, độn thổ trồi lên ngang qua đất liền như ở trong nước, đi trên nước không chìm như trên đất liền, ngồi kiết-già đi trên hư không như con chim;
với bàn tay, chạm và rờ mặt trăng và mặt trời, những vật có đại oai lực, đại oai thần như vậy, có thể tự thân bay đến cõi Phạm Thiên".
Này Sariputta, đối với Sunakkhatta ngu si kia sẽ không có tùy pháp này về Ta như sau:
"Ðây là Thế Tôn với thiên nhĩ thanh tịnh siêu nhân có thể nghe hai loại tiếng chư Thiên và loài Người, xa và gần".
13
536
3394
Này Sariputta, đối với Sunakkhatta ngu si kia sẽ không có tùy pháp nào về Ta như sau:
"Ðây là Thế Tôn, sau khi đi sâu vào tâm chúng sanh, tâm loài Người với tâm của mình, vị ấy biết được như sau:
"Tâm có tham biết là tâm có tham.
Hay tâm không tham biết là tâm không tham...
tâm chuyên chú...
tâm tán loạn...
đại hành tâm...
không phải đại hành tâm...
tâm chưa vô thượng...
tâm vô thượng...
Tâm Thiền định...
Tâm không Thiền định...
tâm giải thoát...
tâm không giải thoát biết là tâm không giải thoát".
Vị ấy biết như vậy.

Này Sariputta, Như Lai có đầy đủ mười Như Lai lực, chính nhờ thành tựu mười lực này, Như Lai tự nhận cho mình địa vị Ngưu Vương, rống tiếng rống con sư tử trong các Hội chúng và chuyển Phạm luân.

"Tại chỗ kia, Ta có tên như thế này, dòng họ như thế này, giai cấp như thế này, thọ khổ lạc như thế này, tuổi thọ đến mức như thế này.
Sau khi chết tại chỗ kia, Ta được sanh ra chỗ nọ.
Tại chỗ ấy, Ta có tên như thế này, dòng họ như thế này, giai cấp như thế này, thọ khổ lạc như thế này, tuổi thọ đến mức như thế này.
Sau khi chết tại chỗ nọ, Ta được sanh ra ở đây".
Như vậy, Như Lai nhớ đến nhiều đời sống quá khứ cùng với các nét đại cương và các chi tiết.

1041
3255
(9) Lại nữa, này Sariputta, Như Lai với thiên nhãn thuần tịnh, siêu nhân, thấy sự sống và chết của chúng sanh.
Như Lai tuệ tri rõ rằng, chúng sanh người hạ liệt, kẻ cao sang, người đẹp đẽ, kẻ thô xấu, người may mắn, kẻ bất hạnh đều do hạnh nghiệp của họ.
Các chúng sanh này làm những ác hạnh về thân, về lời và về ý, phỉ báng các bậc Thánh, theo tà kiến, tạo các nghiệp theo tà kiến.
Những người này sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, phải sanh vào cõi dữ, ác thú, đọa xứ, địa ngục.
Các chúng sanh này làm những thiện hạnh về thân, về lời và về ý, không phỉ báng các bậc Thánh, theo chánh kiến, tạo các nghiệp theo chánh kiến.
Những người này, sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, được sanh lên các thiện thú, cõi Trời, trên đời này.
Như vậy, Như Lai với thiên nhãn thuần tịnh, siêu nhân, thấy sự sống chết của chúng sanh.
Như Lai tuệ tri rằng, chúng sanh, người hạ liệt, kẻ cao sang, người đẹp đẽ, kẻ thô xấu, người may mắn, kẻ bất hạnh, đều do hạnh nghiệp của họ.
Này Sariputta, Như Lai như thật tuệ tri...
(như trên)...
và chuyển Phạm luân.

Này Sariputta, Như Lai có đầy đủ mười Như Lai lực.
Chính nhờ thành tựu mười lực này, Như Lai tự nhận cho mình địa vị Ngưu Vương, rống tiếng rống sư tử trong các Hội chúng và chuyển Phạm luân.
27
896
896
Này Sariputta, nếu ai biết Ta như vậy, thấy Ta như vậy mà còn nói:
"Sa-môn Gotama không có pháp Thượng nhân, không có tri kiến thù thắng xứng đáng bậc Thánh.
Sa-môn Gotama thuyết pháp, pháp ấy tự mình tạo ra, do suy luận tác thành, tùy thuận trắc nghiệm, thuyết pháp cho một mục tiêu đặc biệt, có khả năng hướng thượng, có thể hướng dẫn người thực hành diệt tận khổ đau".
Này Sariputta, nếu người ấy không từ bỏ lời nói ấy;
không từ bỏ tâm ấy, không đoạn trừ tà kiến ấy;
người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.
Này Sariputta, như Tỷ-kheo thành tựu giới hạnh, thành tựu Thiền định, thành tựu trí tuệ có thể chứng được chánh trí ngay trong hiện tại.
Này Sariputta, Ta nói như vậy là sự thành tựu như vậy.
Nếu người ấy không từ bỏ lời nói ấy không từ bỏ tâm ấy, không đoạn trừ tà kiến ấy;
người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.
28

(Bốn pháp vô sở úy)
29
197
1112
Này Sariputta, có bốn pháp vô sở úy chính nhờ thành tựu bốn pháp này, Như Lai tự nhận cho mình địa vị Ngưu Vương, rống tiếng rống con sử tử trong các hội chúng và chuyển Phạm luân.
Thế nào là bốn?
30
359
1471
Này Sariputta, Ta thấy không có lý do gì, một Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn, chư Thiên, Ma vương, Phạm thiên hay một ai ở đời có thể chỉ trích Ta đúng pháp rằng:
"Các pháp này chưa được chứng ngộ hoàn toàn, mà quý vị tự xưng đã chứng ngộ hoàn toàn".
Này Sariputta, vì Ta thấy không có lý do gì như vậy, nên Ta sống đạt được an ổn, đạt được không sợ hãi, đạt được vô úy.
31
203
1674
Này Sariputta, Ta thấy không có lý do gì...
có thể chỉ trích Ta đúng pháp rằng:

Này Sariputta, vì Ta không thấy...
đạt được vô úy.
32
248
1922
Này Sariputta, Ta thấy không có lý do gì...
có thể chỉ trích Ta đúng pháp rằng:
"Những pháp này được gọi là các chướng ngại pháp khi được thực hành thời không có gì gọi là chướng ngại pháp cả".
Này Sariputta, vì Ta không thấy...
đạt được vô úy.
33
419
2341
Này Sariputta, Ta thấy không có lý do gì một Sa-môn Bà-la-môn, chư Thiên, Ma vương, Phạm thiên hay một ai ở đời có thể chỉ trích Ta đúng pháp rằng:
"Pháp do quý vị thuyết giảng không đưa đến mục tiêu đặc biệt, không có khả năng hướng thượng, không có thể dẫn người thực hành đến diệt tận khổ đau".
Này Sariputta, vì Ta thấy không có lý do gì như vậy, nên Ta sống đạt được an ổn, đạt được không sợ hãi, đạt được vô úy.
34
181
2522
Này Sariputta, có bốn pháp vô sở úy, chính nhờ thành tựu bốn pháp này, Như Lai tự nhận cho mình địa vị Ngưu Vương, rống tiếng rống con sử tử trong các hội chúng và chuyển Phạm luân.
35
112
2634
Này Sariputta, nếu ai biết Ta như vậy...
người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.
36
15
2649
(Tám hội chúng)
37
343
2992
Này Sariputta, có tám Hội chúng này:
Hội chúng Sát-đế-lị, Hội chúng Bà-la-môn, Hội chúng Gia chủ, Hội chúng Sa-môn, Hội chúng Tứ thiên vương, Hội chúng Tam thập tam thiên, Hội chúng Màra, Hội chúng Phạm thiên.
Này Sariputta, có tám Hội chúng này.
Này Sariputta, Như Lai thành tựu bốn pháp vô sở úy như vậy, đến gần và vào tám Hội chúng này.
38
390
3382
Này Sariputta, Ta nhớ lại Ta đã đến hàng trăm Hội chúng Sát-đế-lị.
Tuy vậy, trước khi Ta ngồi xuống tại chỗ ấy, trước khi Ta nói chuyện và trước khi Ta đàm luận;
này Sariputta, ta thấy không có lý do gì để nghĩ rằng:
"Chắc chắn sự sợ hãi và run sợ sẽ đến ám ảnh Ta".
Này Sariputta, vì Ta thấy không có lý do gì như vậy, nên Ta sống đạt được an ổn, đạt được không sợ hãi, đạt được vô úy.
39
558
3940
Này Sariputta, Ta nhớ lại, Ta đã đến hàng trăm Hội chúng Bà-la-môn...
(như trên)...
Hội chúng Gia chủ...
Hội chúng Sa-môn...
Hội chúng Tứ thiên vương...
Hội chúng Tam thập tam thiên...
Hội chúng Màra...
Hội chúng Phạm thiên.
Tuy vậy, trước khi Ta ngồi xuống tại chỗ ấy, trước khi Ta nói chuyện và trước khi Ta đàm luận, này Sariputta, Ta thấy không có một lý do gì để nghĩ rằng:
"Chắc chắn sự sợ hãi và run sợ sẽ đến ám ảnh Ta".
Này Sariputta, vì Ta thấy không có lý do gì như vậy, nên Ta sống đạt được an ổn, đạt được không sợ hãi, đạt được vô úy.
40
113
4053
Này Sariputta, nếu ai biết Ta như vậy...
người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục, như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.

Này Sariputta, có bốn loại sanh.
Thế nào là bốn?
Noãn sanh, thai sanh, thấp sanh, hóa sanh.
43
696
696
Này Sariputta, thế nào là noãn sanh?
Này Sariputta, những loại chúng sanh nào phá vỏ trứng, mà sanh, này Sariputta như vậy gọi là noãn sanh.
Và này Sariputta, thế nào là thai sanh?
Này Sariputta, những loại chúng sanh nào phá màn da mỏng che chỗ kín mà sanh, này Sariputta, như vậy gọi là thai sanh.
Và này Sariputta, thế nào là thấp sanh?
Này Sariputta, những loại chúng sanh nào sanh ra từ cá thúi, từ xác chết thúi, từ cháo cơm thúi, hay trong hồ nước dơ hay trong ao nước nhớp.
Này Sariputta, như vậy gọi là thấp sanh.
Và này Sariputta, thế nào là hóa sanh?
Chư Thiên, các chúng sanh ở địa ngục, một số thuộc loài người và một số thuộc đọa xứ.
Này Sariputta, như vậy gọi là hóa sanh.
44
154
850
Này Sariputta có bốn loại sanh như vậy.
Này Sariputta, nếu ai biết Ta như vậy...
người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục, như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.

Này Sariputta, có năm loại sanh thú này.
Thế nào là năm?
Ðịa ngục, bàng sanh, ngạ quỷ, loài Người, chư Thiên.

1212
(1) Này Sariputta, Ta tuệ tri địa ngục, con đường đưa đến địa ngục và hành lộ đưa đến địa ngục.
Tùy theo hạnh nghiệp, sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, phải sanh vào cõi dữ, ác thú, đọa xứ, địa ngục, sự việc này ta cũng tuệ tri.
48

1420

Tùy theo hành nghiệp, sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, sanh vào thiện thú, Thiên giới, thế giới này, sự việc này Ta cũng tuệ tri.
52
299
2385
Và này Sariputta, Ta cũng tuệ tri Niết-bàn, con đường đưa đến Niết-bàn và hành lộ đưa đến Niết-bàn.
Tùy theo hành nghiệp, do đoạn trừ các lậu hoặc, sau khi tự mình với thắng trí, chứng ngộ, chứng đạt và an trú ngay trong hiện tại vô lậu tâm giải thoát, tuệ giải thoát, sự việc này, Ta cũng tuệ tri.
53
1432
3817
(1) Này Sariputta, ở đây, với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người.
Do hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sau khi thân hoại mạng chung sẽ sanh vào cõi dữ, ác thú, đọa xứ, địa ngục như vậy.
Sau một thời gian, với thiên nhãn thanh tịnh, siêu nhân, Ta thấy người ấy, sau khi thân hoại mạng chung sanh vào cõi dữ, ác thú, đọa xứ, địa ngục, phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt.
Này Sariputta, cũng như có một hố than sâu hơn thân người, đầy vun than hừng, không có lửa ngọn, không có khói, và một người đi đến, bị nóng bức áp đảo, bị nóng bức hành hạ, mệt mỏi khô cổ, đắng họng, khát nước, và đi thẳng đến hố than ấy chỉ bằng một con đường.
Một người có mắt thấy người ấy, có thể nói:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đi đến hố than kia".
Sau một thời gian, người ấy sẽ thấy người kia rơi vào hố than ấy và phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt.
Này Sariputta, cũng vậy, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người:

Sau một thời gian, với thiên nhãn thanh tịnh siêu nhân, Ta thấy người ấy sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, sanh vào cõi dữ, ác thú, đọa xứ, địa ngục, phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt.
54
979
979
(2) Này Sariputta, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, sẽ sanh vào bàng sanh".
Sau một thời gian, với thiên nhãn thanh tịnh siêu nhân, Ta thấy kẻ ấy sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, sanh vào bàng sanh, phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt.
Này Sariputta, cũng như có một hố phân, sâu hơn thân người, đầy những phẩn uế, và một người đi đến, bị nóng bức áp đảo, bị nóng bức hành hạ, mệt mỏi, khô cổ, đắng họng, khát nước và đi thẳng đến hố phân ấy chỉ bằng một con đường.
Một người có mắt thấy người ấy có thể nói:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy và bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đi đến hố phân ấy".
Sau một thời gian, người ấy sẽ thấy người kia rơi vào hố phân ấy và phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt.
Này Sariputta, cũng vậy, ở đây với tâm của Ta...
(như trên)...
thống khổ, khốc liệt.
55
877
1856
(3) Này Sariputta, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người "Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy...
sau khi thân hoại mạng chung sẽ sanh vào ngạ quỷ, phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt".
Này Sariputta, cũng như có một cây sống trên miếng đất không bằng phẳng, với lá thưa thớt, với bóng che từng đám lưa thưa.
Và một người đi đến bị nóng bức áp đảo, bị nóng bức hành hạ, mệt mỏi, khô cổ, đắng họng, khát nước và đi thẳng đến cây ấy chỉ bằng một con đường.
Một người có mắt thấy người ấy có thể nói:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy và bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đi đến cây ấy".
Sau một thời gian, người ấy sẽ thấy người kia ngồi hay nằm dưới bóng cây ấy và phải cảm thọ những cảm giác cực khổ, thống khổ, khốc liệt.
Này Sariputta, cũng vậy ở đây với tâm của Ta...
(như trên)...
thống khổ, khốc liệt.
56
890
2746
(4) Này Sariputta, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta biết tâm của một số người:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy...
sau khi thân hoại mạng chung, sẽ sanh vào loài người".
Sau một thời gian...
Ta thấy người ấy sanh vào loài người, và cảm thọ được nhiều cảm giác lạc thọ.
Này Sariputta, cũng như có một cây sống trên miếng đất bằng phẳng với lá sum sê, với bóng cây rậm rạp.
Và một người đi đến, bị nóng bức áp đảo, bị nóng bức hành hạ, mệt mỏi, khô cổ, đắng họng, khát nước và đi thẳng đến cây ấy chỉ bằng một con đường.
Một người có mắt thấy người ấy có thể nói:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ của người này như vậy và bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đi đến cây ấy".
Sau một thời gian, người ấy sẽ thấy người kia, ngồi hay nằm dưới bóng cây ấy và cảm thọ được nhiều cảm giác lạc thọ.
Này Sariputta, cũng vậy, ở đây, với tâm của Ta...
được nhiều cảm giác lạc thọ.
57
1186
3932
(5) Này Sariputta, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy...
sau khi thân hoại mạng chung sẽ sanh vào thiện thú, Thiên giới, cõi đời này".
Sau một thời gian...
Ta thấy người ấy sanh vào thiện thú, Thiên giới, cõi đời này và cảm thọ những cảm giác cực lạc.
Này Sariputta, giống như một ngôi lầu, có gác nhọn, có tô vôi cả trong lẫn ngoài, được che gió, có then chốt đóng lại và có các cửa sổ khép kín.
Tại đây có một sàng tọa, trải nệm lông dài, trải nệm màu trắng, trải nệm bông có thêu hoa, trải nệm bằng da sơn dương gọi là kadali, có nệm với khuôn màu treo phía trên, có gối dài màu đỏ cả hai đầu.
Và một người đi đến, bị nóng bức áp đảo, bị nóng bức hành hạ, mệt mỏi, khô cổ, đắng họng, khát nước và đi thẳng đến ngôi lầu ấy.
Một người có mắt thấy người ấy có thể nói:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, và bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đi đến ngôi lầu ấy".
Sau một thời gian, người ấy sẽ thấy người kia ngồi hay nằm trong ngôi lầu ấy, trong gác nhọn ấy, trên sàng tọa ấy và cảm thọ được nhiều cảm thọ cực lạc.
Này Sariputta, cũng vậy, ở đây với tâm của Ta...
được nhiều cảm giác lạc thọ.
58
1706
1706
(6) Này Sariputta, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đoạn trừ các lậu hoặc, tự mình với thắng trí chứng ngộ, chứng đạt và an trú ngay trong hiện tại vô lậu tâm giải thoát, tuệ giải thoát như vậy".
Sau một thời gian, Ta thấy vị ấy đoạn trừ các lậu hoặc, tự mình với thắng trí chứng ngộ, chứng đạt và an trú ngay trong hiện tại vô lậu tâm giải thoát, tuệ giải thoát, cảm thọ những cảm giác cực lạc.
Này Sariputta, giống như một hồ sen có nước trong, có nước ngọt, có nước mát, có nước trong sáng, có bờ hồ khéo sắp đặt, đẹp đẽ, và không xa hồ ấy có khu rừng rậm rạp.
Một người đi đến, bị nóng bức áp đảo, bị nóng bức hành hạ, mệt mỏi, khô cổ, đắng họng, khát nước và đi thẳng đến hồ sen ấy.
Một người có mắt thấy người ấy có thể nói:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, và bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đi đến hồ sen ấy".
Sau một thời gian, người ấy sẽ thấy người kia, sau khi tẩm mình vào hồ sen ấy, sau khi tắm rửa, uống nước và làm cho dịu bớt mọi ưu tư, mệt mỏi, phiền não, sau khi ra khỏi hồ liền qua ngồi hay nằm trong rừng cây rậm rạp ấy và cảm thọ những cảm giác cực lạc.
Cũng vậy, này Sariputta, ở đây với tâm của Ta, Ta tuệ tri tâm của một số người:
"Hành nghiệp của người này như vậy, cử chỉ như vậy, bước vào đạo lộ như vậy, sẽ đoạn trừ các lậu hoặc, tự mình với thắng trí chứng ngộ, chứng đạt và an trú ngay trong hiện tại vô lậu tâm giải thoát, tuệ giải thoát như vậy".
Sau một thời gian, Ta thấy vị ấy đoạn trừ các lậu hoặc, tự mình với thắng trí chứng ngộ, chứng đạt và an trú ngay trong hiện tại vô lậu tâm giải thoát, tuệ giải thoát, cảm thọ những cảm giác cực lạc.
59
825
2531
Này Sariputta, năm loại này là năm sanh thú.
Này Sariputta, có ai biết Ta như vậy, thấy Ta như vậy, và nói:
"Sa-môn Gotama không có pháp Thượng nhân, không có tri kiến thù thắng xứng đáng bậc Thánh.
Sa-môn Gotama thuyết pháp, pháp ấy tự mình tạo ra, do suy luận tác thành, tùy thuộc trắc nghiệm".
Này Sariputta, nếu người ấy không từ bỏ lời nói ấy, không từ bỏ tâm ấy, không đoạn trừ tà kiến ấy, thì người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.
Này Sariputta, Tỷ-kheo thành tựu giới hạnh, thành tựu thiền định, thành tựu trí tuệ, có thể chứng được chánh trí ngay trong hiện tại.
Này Sariputta, Ta nói như vậy là sự thành tựu như vậy.
Nếu người ấy không từ bỏ lời nói ấy, không từ bỏ tâm ấy, không đoạn trừ tà kiến ấy, thì người ấy sẽ bị rơi vào địa ngục như một gánh nặng bị quăng bỏ một bên.
60
21
2552
(Khổ hạnh của Bồ-tát)
61
183
2735
Này Sariputta, Ta thắng tri phạm hạnh, đầy đủ bốn hạnh:
về khổ hạnh, Ta khổ hạnh đệ nhất;
về bần uế, Ta bần uế đệ nhất;
về yểm ly, Ta yểm ly đệ nhất;
về độc cư, Ta độc cư đệ nhất.
62
2308
2308
Này Sariputta, ở đây, khổ hạnh của Ta như sau:
Ta sống lõa thể, phóng túng, không theo khuôn phép, liếm tay cho sạch, đi khất thực không chịu bước tới, không nhận đồ ăn mang đến, không nhận đồ ăn đặc biệt nấu cho mình, không nhận mời đi ăn, không nhận đồ ăn từ nơi nồi chảo, không nhận đồ ăn tại ngưỡng cửa, không nhận đồ ăn đặt giữa những cây gậy, không nhận đồ ăn đặt giữa những cối giã gạo, không nhận đồ ăn từ hai người đang ăn, không nhận đồ ăn từ người đàn bà có thai, không nhận đồ ăn từ người đàn bà đang cho con bú, không nhận đồ ăn từ người đàn bà đang giao cấu, không nhận đồ ăn đi quyên, không nhận đồ ăn tại chỗ có chó đứng, không nhận đồ ăn tại chỗ có ruồi bu, không ăn cá, ăn thịt, không uống rượu nấu, rượu men.
Ta chỉ nhận đồ ăn tại một nhà, chỉ nhận ăn một miếng, hay chỉ nhận ăn tại hai nhà, chỉ nhận ăn hai miếng, hay chỉ nhận ăn tại bảy nhà, chỉ nhận ăn bảy miếng.
Ta nuôi sống chỉ với một chén, nuôi sống chỉ với hai chén, nuôi sống chỉ với bảy chén.
Ta chỉ ăn một ngày một bữa, hai ngày một bữa, bảy ngày một bữa.
Như vậy Ta sống theo hạnh tiết chế ăn uống cho đến nửa tháng mới ăn một lần.
Ta chỉ ăn cỏ lúa để sống, lúa tắc, gạo lức, ăn hột cải nivara, ăn da vụn, ăn trấu, uống nước bột gạo, ăn bột vừng, ăn cỏ, ăn phân bò, ăn trái cây, ăn rễ cây trong rừng, ăn trái cây rụng để sống.
Ta mặc vải gai thô, mặc vải gai thô lẫn với các vải khác, mặc vải tẩm liệm rồi quăng đi, mặc áo phấn tảo y, mặc vỏ cây tititaka làm áo, mặc da con sơn dương đen, mặc áo bện từng mảnh da con sơn dương đen, mặc áo bằng cỏ cát tường, mặc áo vỏ cây, mặc áo bằng tấm gỗ nhỏ, mặc áo bằng tóc bện lại thành mền, mặc áo bằng đuôi ngựa bện lại, mặc áo bằng lông cú.
Ta sống nhổ râu tóc, Ta theo tập tục sống nhổ râu tóc, Ta theo hạnh thường đứng không dùng chỗ ngồi, Ta là người ngồi chõ hỏ, sống tinh tấn theo hạnh ngồi chõ hỏ.
Ta dùng gai làm giường, thường ngủ nằm trên giường gai, sống dùng ván gỗ làm giường, sống nằm trên đất trần, thường nằm ngủ một bên hông, sống để bụi và nhớp che dính thân mình, sống và ngủ ngoài trời, theo hạnh bạ đâu nằm đấy, sống ăn các uế vật, sống không uống nước lạnh, theo hạnh không uống nước lạnh, sống một đêm tắm ba lần, theo hạnh xuống nước tắm.
Như vậy Ta sống theo hạnh hành hạ, dày vò thân thể theo nhiều cách.
Này Sariputta, như vậy là khổ hạnh của Ta.
63
575
2883
Này Sariputta, ở đây hạnh bần uế của Ta như sau:
Trên thân Ta, bụi bặm chất đầy trải nhiều năm tháng, đóng thành tấm, thành miếng.
Như gốc cây tinduka bụi bặm chất đầy trải nhiều năm tháng, đóng thành tấm, thành miếng;
cũng vậy, này Sariputta, trên thân Ta bụi bặm chất đầy trải nhiều năm tháng, đóng thành tấm, thành miếng.
Này Sariputta, Ta không nghĩ rằng:
"Với tay của Ta, Ta hãy phủi sạch bụi bặm này đi, hay những người khác với tay của họ hãy phủi sạch bụi bặm này đi cho Ta".
Này Sariputta, Ta không có nghĩ như vậy.
Này Sariputta, như vậy là sự bần uế của Ta.
64
289
3172
Này Sariputta, như thế này là sự yểm ly của Ta.
Này Sariputta, tỉnh giác, Ta đi tới;
tỉnh giác Ta đi lui, Ta an trú lòng từ cho đến trong một giọt nước với tâm tư:
"Mong rằng Ta không làm hại một chúng sanh nhỏ nào trong những ác đạo của họ!" Này Sariputta, như vậy là sự yểm ly của Ta.
65
1007
4179
Này Sariputta, như thế này là sự độc cư của Ta.
Này Sariputta, Ta đi sâu vào một khu rừng và an trú tại chỗ ấy.
Khi Ta thấy người chăn bò, người mục súc, người cắt cỏ, người đốn củi hay người thợ rừng, Ta liền chạy từ rừng này qua rừng khác, từ lùm cây này qua lùm cây khác, từ thung lũng này qua thung lũng khác, từ đồi cao này qua đồi cao khác.
Vì sao vậy?
Ta nghĩ rằng:
"Mong họ đừng thấy Ta, và mong Ta đừng thấy họ!" Này Sariputta, giống như một con thú rừng thấy người liền chạy từ rừng này qua rừng khác, từ lùm cây này qua lùm cây khác, từ thung lũng này qua thung lũng khác, từ đồi cao này qua đồi cao khác.
Cũng vậy, này Sariputta, khi Ta thấy người chăn bò, người mục súc, người cắt cỏ, người đốn củi, hay người tiều phu, Ta liền chạy từ rừng này qua rừng khác, từ lùm cây này qua lùm cây khác, từ thung lũng này qua thung lũng khác, từ đồi cao này qua đồi cao khác.
Vì sao vậy?
Ta nghĩ rằng:
"Mong họ đừng thấy Ta, và mong Ta đừng thấy họ!" Này Sariputta, như vậy là hạnh độc cư của Ta.
66
321
321
Này Sariputta, rồi Ta bò bốn chân đến các chuồng bò, khi các con bò cái đã bỏ đi, khi các người chăn bò không có mặt, rồi Ta ăn phân các con bò con, các con bò còn trẻ, các con bò còn bú.
Khi nước tiểu và phân của Ta còn tồn tại, Ta tự nuôi sống với các loại ấy.
Này Sariputta, như vậy là hạnh đại bất tịnh thực của Ta.
67
601
922
Này Sariputta, Ta đi sâu vào một khu rừng rậm rạp kinh hoàng và an trú tại chỗ ấy.
Này Sariputta, tại khu rừng rậm rạp kinh hoàng này, những ai còn tham ái đi vào khu rừng rậm rạp ấy, thời lông tóc người ấy dựng ngược.
Này Sariputta, rồi Ta trong những đêm đông lạnh lẽo, giữa những ngày mồng tám, khi có tuyết rơi, trong những đêm như vậy, Ta sống giữa trời, và ban ngày sống trong khu rừng rậm rạp.
Ta sống trong những ngày cuối tháng hè, ban ngày thì sống giữa trời, còn ban đêm trong khu rừng rậm rạp.
Rồi này Sariputta, những bài kệ kỳ diệu từ trước chưa từng được nghe sau đây được khởi lên:
68
31
953
Nay bị thiêu đốt, bị buốt lạnh,
69
34
987
Cô độc sống trong rừng kinh hoàng,
70
34
1021
Trần truồng, Ta ngồi không lửa ấm,
71
32
1053
Ẩn sĩ, trong lý tưởng đăm chiêu.
72
303
1356
Này Sariputta, Ta nằm ngủ trong bãi tha ma, dựa trên một bộ xương.
Này Sariputta, những đứa mục đồng đến gần Ta, khạc nhổ trên Ta, tiểu tiện trên Ta, rắc bụi trên Ta và lấy que đâm vào lỗ tai.
Này Sariputta, và Ta biết Ta không khởi ác tâm đối với chúng.
Này Sariputta, như vậy là hạnh trú xả của Ta.
73
1716
3072
Này Sariputta, lại có một số Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn có những thuyết như sau, có những kiến giải như sau:
"Sự thanh tịnh đạt được nhờ món ăn".
Họ nói:
"Chúng ta sống nhờ trái táo", và họ ăn trái táo, họ ăn bột táo, họ uống nước trái táo dưới nhiều hình thức.
Này Sariputta, Ta tự xưng Ta sống chỉ ăn một trái táo.
Này Sariputta, có thể các Người nghĩ như sau:
"Trái táo thời ấy to lớn".
Này Sariputta, chớ có hiểu như vậy.
Vì trái táo thời ấy giống với trái táo hiện tại.
Này Sariputta, trong khi Ta sống chỉ ăn một trái táo, thân thể của Ta trở thành hết sức ốm yếu.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, tay chân Ta trở thành như những cọng cỏ hay những đốt cây leo khô héo.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, bàn trôn của Ta trở thành như móng chân con lạc đà.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, các xương sống phô bày của Ta giống như một chuỗi banh.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, các xương sườn gầy mòn của Ta giống như rui cột nhà sàn hư nát.
Vì ta ăn quá ít, nên con ngươi của Ta long lanh nằm sâu thẳm trong lỗ con mắt, giống như ánh nước long lanh nằm sâu thẳm trong một giếng nước thâm sâu.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, da đầu Ta trở thành nhăn nheo khô cằn như trái bí trắng và đắng bị cắt trước khi chín, bị cơn gió nóng làm cho nhăn nheo khô cằn.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta nghĩ:
"Ta hãy sờ da bụng", chính xương sống bị Ta nắm lấy.
Nếu Ta nghĩ:
"Ta hãy sờ xương sống", thì chính da bụng bị Ta nắm lấy.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, nên này Sariputta, da bụng của Ta bám chặt xương sống.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta nghĩ:
"Ta đi đại tiện hay đi tiểu tiện", thì Ta ngã quỵ, úp mặt xuống đất, vì Ta ăn quá ít.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta muốn thoa dịu thân Ta, lấy tay xoa bóp chân tay, thì này Sariputta, trong khi Ta lấy tay xoa bóp chân tay, các lông tóc hư mục rụng khỏi thân Ta, vì Ta ăn quá ít.
74
1839
1839
Này Sariputta, lại có một số Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn có những chủ thuyết như sau, có những kiến giải như sau:
"Sự thanh tịnh đạt được nhờ món ăn".
Họ nói:
"Chúng ta sống nhờ đậu xanh...
(như trên)...
chúng ta sống nhờ vừng mè...
(như trên)...
chúng ta sống nhờ hột gạo", và họ ăn hột gạo, họ ăn hột gạo nghiền thành bột, họ uống nước gạo, và họ ăn hột gạo dưới nhiều hình thức.
Này Sariputta, Ta tự xưng Ta sống chỉ ăn một hột gạo.
Này Sariputta, có thể các Người nghĩ như sau:
"Hột gạo thời ấy to lớn".
Này Sariputta, chớ có hiểu như vậy.
Vì hột gạo thời ấy giống với hột gạo hiện tại.
Này Sariputta, trong khi Ta chỉ sống ăn một hột gạo, thân thể của Ta trở thành hết sức ốm yếu.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, tay chân Ta trở thành như những cọng cỏ hay những đốt cây leo khô héo.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, bàn trôn của Ta trở thành như móng chân con lạc đà.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, xương sống phô bày của Ta giống như một chuỗi banh.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít các xương sườn gầy mòn của Ta giống như rui cột của một nhà sàn hư nát.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, con ngươi long lanh của Ta nằm sâu thẳm trong lỗ con mắt, giống như ánh nước long lanh nằm sâu thẳm trong một giếng nước thâm sâu.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, da đầu Ta trở thành nhăn nheo, khô cằn như trái bí trắng và đắng bị cắt trước khi chín, bị cơn gió nóng làm cho nhăn nheo, khô cằn.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta nghĩ:
"Ta hãy sờ da bụng", thì chính xương sống bị Ta nắm lấy.
Nếu Ta nghĩ:
"Ta hãy rờ xương sống", thì chính da bụng bị Ta nắm lấy.
Vì Ta ăn quá ít, nên này Sariputta, da bụng của Ta bám chặt xương sống.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta nghĩ:
"Ta đi đại tiện hay đi tiểu tiện", thì Ta ngã quỵ, úp mặt xuống đất, vì Ta ăn quá ít.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta muốn xoa dịu thân Ta, lấy tay xoa bóp chân tay, thời này Sariputta, trong khi Ta lấy tay xoa bóp chân tay, các lông tóc hư mục rụng khỏi thân Ta, vì Ta ăn quá ít.
75
409
2248
Này Sariputta, dầu Ta có theo cử chỉ như vậy, theo hành lộ như vậy, theo khổ hạnh như vậy, Ta cũng không chứng được các pháp thượng nhân, không có tri kiến thù thắng xứng đáng bậc Thánh.
Vì sao vậy?
Vì với những phương tiện ấy, không chứng được pháp thượng nhân với Thánh trí tuệ.
Chính Thánh trí tuệ này chứng được thuộc về bậc Thánh, có khả năng hướng thượng, có thể dẫn người thực hành diệt tận khổ đau.
76
395
2643
Này Sariputta, lại có một số Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn có những chủ thuyết như sau, có những kiến giải như sau:
"Sự thanh tịnh chứng đạt được nhờ luân hồi".
Này Sariputta, thật không dễ gì tìm được sự luân hồi mà xưa kia Ta không trải qua trong một thời gian khá dài, trừ phi với các vị Tịnh cư thiên (Suddhavasa).
Này Sariputta, nếu Ta luân hồi tại Tịnh cư thiên thì Ta đã không trở lại đời này nữa.

Này Sariputta, lại có một số Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn có những chủ thuyết như sau, có những kiến giải như sau:
"Khi một thiếu niên còn trẻ tuổi, tóc đen nhánh, huyết khí sung mãn, trong tuổi thanh xuân, người ấy thành tựu trí tuệ biện tài tối thượng.
Nhưng khi người ấy già cả, niên cao, lạp lớn, đã đến tuổi trưởng thượng, đã đi đến đoạn cuối cuộc đời, khi đã tám mươi, chín mươi hay một trăm tuổi, khi ấy trí tuệ biện tài tối thượng ấy bị đoạn trừ".
Này Sariputta, chớ có quan niệm như vậy.
Này Sariputta, nay Ta đã già, niên cao, lạp lớn, đã đến tuổi trưởng thượng, đã đi dến đoạn cuối cuộc đời, tuổi Ta nay đã đến tám mươi.
Này Sariputta, ở đây Ta có bốn vị đệ tử, tuổi thọ đến một trăm, đã sống một trăm tuổi, thành tựu chánh niệm đệ nhất, thành tựu chuyên tâm đệ nhất, thành tựu tinh cần đệ nhất và đầy đủ trí tuệ biện tài tối thượng.
Này Sariputta, ví như một người bắn cung thiện xảo, có huấn luyện, khéo tay, thuần thục, với một mũi tên nhẹ, có thể dễ dàng bắn ngang qua bóng một cây ta-la.
Cũng vậy, những vị này với chánh niệm đệ nhất như vậy, được thành tựu trí tuệ biện tài tối thượng như vậy, nếu những vị này hỏi Ta nhiều lần một câu hỏi về Bốn Niệm xứ, và nếu Ta, được hỏi nhiều lần như vậy, phải giải thích cho họ hiểu và nếu họ được Ta giải thích như vậy, có thể hiểu như đã giải thích, và nếu họ không hỏi Ta về những vấn đề phụ thuộc và các vấn đề khác, trừ khi ăn, uống, nhai, nếm, trừ khi đi đại tiện, tiểu tiện, trừ khi ngủ để lấy lại sức.
Này Sariputta, dầu vậy, sự thuyết pháp của Như Lai cũng chưa hoàn tất, sự giải thích cú pháp của Như Lai cũng chưa hoàn tất, sự trả lời các câu hỏi của Như Lai cũng chưa hoàn tất, khi mà bốn đệ tử của Ta, tuổi thọ đến một trăm tuổi, đã sống một trăm tuổi, đã từ trần sau một trăm tuổi.
Này Sariputta, nếu Ông có gánh Ta trên giường đi chỗ này chỗ kia, thật sự trí tuệ biện tài của Như Lai không có gì thay đổi.

Này Sariputta, những ai nói một cách chân chánh sẽ nói như sau:
"Một vị hữu tình không bị si chi phối, đã sanh ra ở đời vì lợi ích, vì hạnh phúc cho chúng sanh, vì lòng thương tưởng cho đời, vì lợi ích, vì hạnh phúc, vì an lạc cho chư Thiên và loài Người".
Vị ấy sẽ nói về Ta một cách chân chánh như sau:
"Một vị hữu tình không bị si chi phối, đã sanh ra ở đời vì lợi ích, vì hạnh phúc cho chúng sanh, vì lòng thương tưởng cho đời, vì lợi ích, vì hạnh phúc, vì an lạc cho chư Thiên và loài Người".

Lúc bấy giờ Tôn giả Nagasamala đứng sau lưng Thế Tôn và quạt cho Ngài!
Tôn giả Nagasamala bạch Thế Tôn:

2643
-- Thật vi diệu thay, bạch Thế Tôn!
Thật hy hữu thay, bạch Thế Tôn!
Sau khi nghe pháp môn này, lông tóc con dựng ngược.
Bạch Thế Tôn, pháp môn này tên gọi là gì?
85
103
2746
-- Này Nagasamala, do vậy pháp môn này gọi là "Pháp môn Lông tóc dựng ngược".
Ông hãy như vậy thọ trì.

Thế Tôn thuyết giảng như vậy.
Tôn giả Nagasamala hoan hỷ, tín thọ lời dạy của Thế Tôn.
