Venerable friends, what is the delusion, what is the origin of the delusion, what is the cessation of the delusion, what is the path leading to the cessation of the delusion?
Dear friends, there are these three defilements:
The taint of desire, the taint of existence, and the taint of ignorance.
From the origin of ignorance there is the origin of delusion;
From the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of delusion and this Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the cessation of delusion, that is:
Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.
100
506
1012
Dear Venerables, when a noble disciple understands the delusions like that, understands the origin of the delusions like that, understands the cessation of the delusions like that, understands the path leading to the cessation of the delusions like that, then he eliminates all the delusions of greed, purifies the delusions of anger, uproots the arrogant view of the delusion "I am", eliminates ignorance, causes wisdom to arise, and puts an end to suffering right in the present.
Dear Venerables, then the Holy Disciple has right knowledge, has straight knowledge, has absolute faith in the Dharma and achieves this wonderful Dharma.
101
105
1117
Venerable Sariputta preached like that.
Those monks were delighted and believed in the teachings of the Venerable Sariputta.
