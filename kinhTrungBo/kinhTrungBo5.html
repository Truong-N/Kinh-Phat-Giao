At one time the World-Honored One was at Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika (Anathapindika).
Staying here, Venerable Sariputta (Sariputra) called the monks.
"Signed Monks".
--"Friend", those monks responded to Venerable Sariputta.
Venerable Sariputta said as follows:
6
483
841
-- Dear Venerables, there are four types of people in this world.
What is four?
Venerable monks, here, there are people who have flaws, but do not truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
Again, Venerable Ones, here, there are people who have blemishes, and truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
Again, Venerable Ones, there are people here who have no blemishes, but do not truly understand:
"My body has no impurities".
Furthermore, Venerable Ones, here, there are people who are free from blemishes and truly understand:
"My body has no impurities".
7
354
1195
Venerable Ones, here, people have impurities but do not truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
Of the two types of people who have impurities, this type of person is therefore called the lower class of people.
Venerable Ones, here, people who have impurities and truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
Of the two types of people with impurities, this type of person is therefore called the superior type of person.
8

Venerable monks, here, there are people who have no blemishes but do not truly understand:
"My body has no impurities".
Of the two classes of people who have no impurities, this class of people is therefore called the lower class of people.
Venerable Ones, here, a person without blemishes and truly understands:
"My body has no impurities".
Of the two types of people who have no impurities, this type of person is therefore called the superior person.
9
95
1683
Having said so, Venerable Mahamoggallana (Great Maudgalyayana) said to Venerable Sariputta as follows:
10
314
1997
-- Venerable Sariputta, what is the cause, what is the cause, of these two types of people with impurities, one is called inferior, the other is called superior?
Venerable Sariputta, what is the cause, what is the cause of these two types of people who are impeccable, one is called inferior, the other is called superior?
11
651
2648
-- Here, Sage, people who have impurities but do not truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
For this person, the following can be expected:
"This person will not aspire to desire, will not try, will not be diligent to eliminate that defilement.
This person will die while still having greed, still having anger, still having ignorance, while still being impure, while still having a polluted mind."
Venerable Sir, it is like a bronze bowl brought from the market or from the blacksmith's house, covered with dust, and the owner of that bowl does not use it, does not clean it, and throws the bowl into a dusty place.
Venerable Sir, like that, after a while, that bowl becomes more polluted and full of dust.
12
32
2680
-- Hey Sage, that's the truth.
13
357
3037
-- Venerable Sir, thus people have impurities but do not truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
For this person, the following can be expected:
"This person will not aspire to desire, will not try, will not be diligent to eliminate that defilement.
This person will die while still having greed, anger, and ignorance, while still impure, while his mind is still infected."
14
636
3673
Here, Venerable One, people have impurities, and as it really is, they understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
For this person, the following can be expected:
"This person will have a desire, will try, will be diligent to eliminate that defilement.
This person will pass away from this world without greed, without anger, without ignorance, without impurities, without impurities in the mind."
Venerable Sir, it is like a bronze bowl brought from the market or from the blacksmith's house, covered with dust, and the owner of that bowl uses it, cleans it and does not throw that bowl into a dusty place.
Venerable Sir, that bowl will become purer and cleaner after a while.
15
32
3705
-- Hey Sage, that's the truth.
16
359
4064
-- Venerable Sir, in this way people who have impurities and truly understand:
"My inner body has impurities."
For this type of person, you can expect the following:
"This person will have a desire, will try, will be diligent, to eliminate that defilement.
This person will pass away from this world without greed, without anger, without ignorance, without impurities, without impurities in the mind."
17
667
667
Here, Venerable Sir, a person without impurities does not truly understand:
"My body has no impurities".
For this person, the following can be expected:
"This person will meditate on the pure form.
Due to thoughts of pure appearance, greed will pollute this person's mind.
This person will die while still having greed, still having anger, still having ignorance, while still being impure, while still having a polluted mind."
Venerable Sir, it is like a bronze bowl brought from the market or from the blacksmith's house, pure and clean.
And the owner of that bowl did not use it, did not clean it, and threw the bowl into a dusty place.
Venerable Sir, that bowl, after a while, becomes more polluted and dustier.
18
32
699
-- Hey Sage, that's the truth.
19
364
1063
-- Venerable Sir, such a person has no impurities but does not truly understand:
"My body has no impurities".
For this person, you can wait later:
"This person will meditate on the pure form.
Due to thoughts of pure appearance, greed will pollute this person's mind.
This person will die while still having greed, anger, and ignorance, while still impure, while his mind is still polluted."
20
698
1761
Here, Venerable One, a person without blemishes and truly understands:
"My body has no impurities".
For this person, you can wait as follows:
"This person will not contemplate pure form.
By not thinking about the pure form, greed will not pollute this person's mind.
This person will pass away without greed, without anger, without ignorance, without impurities, without impurities in the mind."
Venerable Sir, it is like a bronze bowl brought from the market or from the blacksmith's house, pure and clean and the owner of that bowl uses it, cleans it and does not throw it into a dusty place.
Venerable Sir, then that bowl, after a while, becomes more pure and cleaner.
21
32
1793
-- Hey Sage, that's the truth.
22
363
2156
-- Venerable Sir, such a person has no blemishes, and truly understands:
"My body has no impurities".
For this person, you can wait as follows:
"This person will not contemplate pure form.
Because of not thinking about pure form, greed will not pollute this person's mind.
This person will die without greed, without anger, without ignorance, without impurities, and without impurities in his mind."
23
298
2454
Venerable Moggallana, due to this cause, due to this condition, among two people with this defilement, one is called inferior, the other is called superior.
Venerable Moggallana, due to this cause, due to this condition, among these two people who do not have this defilement, one is called inferior, the other is called superior.
24
82
2536
-- Hey Sage, impurities are called impurities, what is the synonym for the so-called impurities?
25
90
2626
-- Dear Sir, all evil and unwholesome dharmas and realms of desire are synonymous with the so-called impurities.

Dear Sir, these evil, unwholesome dharmas and realms of desire are synonymous with the so-called impurities.
40
512
4093
Venerable monk, for any monk, these evil, unwholesome dharmas, realms of desire that are still seen and heard have not been eliminated, if that monk is one who lives in the mountains and forests, in remote places, lives the alms-begging practice, a kind of alms-begging class from house to house, following the practice of wearing powdery robes, wearing shabby clothes, then his fellow monks will not revere, respect, worship, or make offerings to that monk.
Why is that?
Because these Venerable Ones can still see and hear the evil and unwholesome dharmas, the monks' realm of desire has not been eliminated.
41
527
527
Venerable Sir, like a bronze bowl brought from the market or from the blacksmith's house, that bowl is pure and clean.
But the owner of that bowl filled the bowl with snake, dog or human corpses, covered it with another bronze bowl and brought it back to the market.
Someone saw that and asked:
"What do you bring that looks so delicious?" When he picks up the bowl, opens it and looks in, dislike arises for him, disgust arises, and resentment arises.
People who are hungry don't want to eat those things yet, let alone people who are full.
42
516
1043
Dear Venerable Monk, for any Bhikkhu, these evil, unwholesome dharmas, realms of desire that are still seen and heard have not been eliminated, if that Bhikkhu is one who lives in the mountains and forests, in remote places, lives the alms-begging practice, the kind of alms-begging class from house to house, following the practice of wearing powdery robes, wearing shabby clothes, then his fellow monks will not revere, respect, worship, or make offerings to that Bhikkhu.
Why is that?
Because these Venerable Ones can still see and hear evil and unwholesome dharmas, this realm of desire has not yet been eliminated.
43
427
1470
Venerable Sir, for any Bhikkhu where these evil, unwholesome dharmas and realms of desire are seen and heard to have been eliminated, if that Bhikkhu lives near a village, accepts a special request for food, wears the householder's robe, then his fellow monks will revere, respect, worship, and make offerings to that Bhikkhu.
Why is that?
Because these Venerable Monks were able to see and hear evil and unwholesome dharmas, the monk's realm of desire was eliminated.
44
527
1997
Venerable Sir, like a bronze bowl brought from the market or from the blacksmith's house, that bowl is pure and clean.
The owner of that bowl filled it with delicious rice, healthy rice, removed black seeds, all kinds of food, covered it with another copper bowl and brought it back to the market.
When the people saw this, they asked:
"What do you bring that looks so delicious?" When he picks up the bowl, opens it and looks in, for him, liking arises, non-disgust arises, non-disgust arises.
A full person still wants to eat those things, let alone a hungry person.
45
433
2430
Likewise, Venerable Sir, for any Bhikkhu, whose evil, unwholesome dharmas, and realms of desire are seen and heard to have been eliminated, if that Bhikkhu lives on the border near a village, accepts a special request for food, wears robes offered by the homeowner, then his fellow monks will revere and respect him, worship and make offerings to that Bhikkhu.
Why is that?
Because these Venerable Ones have seen and heard that the evil and unwholesome dharma realms of this desire have been eliminated.
46
69
2499
Hearing that, Venerable Mahamoggallana said to Venerable Sariputta:
47
50
2549
-- Sage Sariputta, an example arose for me!
48
45
2594
-- Sage Moggallana, please give that example.
49
1019
3613
-- Sage, once I was in Rajagaha, in Giribbaja.
Dear Sir, I put on my robes in the morning, brought my robe and bowl, and entered Rajagrha city to beg for alms.
At that time, Samiti, the son of a cart maker, was carving a wheel rim, and the heretical Panduputta, formerly the son of a cart maker, was standing to one side.
Then the wrong life of a pagan Panduputta was formerly the son of a car maker, and the following thought arose:
"I hope that the Samiti, the wheelwright, will carve out this curve, this distortion and these wooden knots, so that this wheel rim has no curves, no distorted lines, no knots, is smooth and placed on the main shaft."
Venerable Sir, Panduputta, who was the son of a car maker, thought like this, now it is like that, the Samiti, the car maker, carved this curve, this distortion and these wooden knots of that wheel rim.
Venerable Sir, Panduputta, who had the wrong life as a non-Buddhist, was formerly a car-maker. He happily said the following words of joy:
"It seems like this person is carving (that rim) as if with his mind, he knows my mind."
50
655
655
Venerable Sir, those who do not have faith, for the sake of living, not for the sake of faith, become monks, living a homeless life, those who are deceitful, deceitful, restless, arrogant, wavering, talkative, gossipy, do not protect the senses, are not moderate in eating and drinking, do not pay attention to vigilance, do not earnestly follow the monkhood, do not fervently respect the Buddha Dharma, prefer to live a comfortable life, are lazy, are leading the way to downfall, denial. abandoning the important responsibility of living in isolation, being lazy and not being diligent, being forgetful and not paying attention, not concentrating the mind, having a scattered mind, paralyzing wisdom, and being stupid.
Venerable Sariputta with this method, as with the Venerable's mind, the Venerable knows the minds of those types of people.
51
760
1415
Good men, due to their faith, left home, left their families, and lived without families;
Those who are free from deception, not deceitful, not fussy, not restless, not arrogant, not wavering, not talkative, not gossiping, guarding the senses, moderate in eating and drinking, attentive to vigilance, earnest in the monk's conduct, fervently respecting the Dharma, not living in prosperity, not lazy, abandoning the burden of falling, leading in renunciation, diligence, diligence, effort, attentive vigilance, concentration, single-mindedness, wisdom wise, not stupid.
These people, after hearing this method of Venerable Sariputta, seemed to be drinking, seemed to be tasting with their words and minds.
How good it is that a Venerable fellow in the holy life has made it possible to overcome unwholesomeness and abide in the rightly wholesome!
52
500
1915
Dear Sir, let's say a woman or man, still young and fond of jewelry, after washing his hair, after receiving a wreath of blue lotus flowers or a wreath of flowers, or a wreath of kindness, uses both hands to hold that wreath and place it on top of his head.
Venerable Sir, in the same way, good men have left home because of their faith, renouncing their families and living without families, in a space of disguise...
(as above)...
How good it is that a Venerable fellow in the holy life has been able to overcome unwholesomeness and abide in the rightly wholesome!
53
67
1982
Thus, those two noble people spoke good words together and rejoiced together.

Thế nào là bốn?
Chư Hiền, ở đây, có hạng người có cấu uế, nhưng không như thật tuệ tri:
"Nội thân ta có cấu uế".
Lại nữa chư Hiền, ở đây, có hạng người có cấu uế, và như thật tuệ tri:

Chư Hiền, ở đây, hạng người có cấu uế và như thật tuệ tri:
"Nội thân ta có cấu uế".
Trong hai hạng người có cấu uế, hạng người này vì vậy được gọi là hạng người ưu thắng.

Người này sẽ từ trần, trong khi còn có tham, còn có sân, còn có si, trong khi còn cấu uế, trong khi tâm còn ô nhiễm".
Này Hiền giả, giống như một cái bát bằng đồng, mang từ chợ về hay mang từ nhà thợ rèn về, phủ đầy bụi bặm, và người chủ cái bát ấy không dùng đến, không lau chùi và quăng cái bát ấy vào chỗ đầy bụi bặm.

-- Hiền giả, một thời tôi ở thành Vương Xá, tại Giribbaja.
Này Hiền giả, rồi tôi đắp y vào buổi sáng, mang theo y bát, vào thành Vương Xá để khất thực.
Lúc bấy giờ, Samiti, con một người làm xe, đang đẽo một vành xe, và tà mạng ngoại đạo Panduputta, trước là con của một người làm xe, đang đứng một bên.
Rồi tà mạng ngoại đạo Panduputta trước là con một người làm xe, khởi lên ý nghĩ như sau:
"Mong rằng Samiti, con người thợ xe, hãy đẽo đường cong này, đường méo này và các mắt gỗ này, để vành xe này không có cong, không có đường méo, không có mắt gỗ, được trơn tru và được đặt vào trong trục chính".
Này Hiền giả, tà mạng ngoại đạo Panduputta, trước là con một người làm xe suy nghĩ như thế nào, thời đúng như vậy, Samiti, con người làm xe, đẽo đường cong này, đường méo này và các mắt gỗ này của vành xe ấy.
Này Hiền giả, tà mạng ngoại đạo Panduputta trước là con người làm xe, hoan hỷ nói lên lời hoan hỷ như sau:
"Hình như người này đang đẽo (vành xe ấy) như là với tâm của anh ta, anh ta biết tâm ta vậy".
50

Này Hiền giả, những ai không có lòng tin, vì mục đích sinh sống, không phải vì lòng tin mà xuất gia, sống đời sống vô gia đình, những vị gian ngụy, xảo trá, khi cuống, trạo cử, kiêu mạn, dao động, lắm lời, tạp thoại, không hộ trì các căn, không tiết độ trong ăn uống, không chú tâm cảnh giác, không tha thiết với hạnh Sa-môn, không nhiệt thành tôn trọng Phật pháp, ưa sống sung túc, biếng nhác, dẫn đầu về đọa lạc, chối bỏ trọng trách sống viễn ly, giải đãi không tinh tấn, lãng quên không chú niệm, không định tâm, tâm tán loạn, liệt tuệ, đần độn.
Tôn giả Sariputta với pháp môn này, như là với tâm của Tôn giả, Tôn giả biết tâm của những hạng người ấy.
51
760
1415
Những kẻ Thiện nam tử, do lòng tin, xuất gia, từ bỏ gia đình, sống không gia đình;
những vị nào không gian ngụy, không xảo trá, không khi cuống, không trạo cử, không kiêu mạn, không dao động, không lắm lời, không tạp thoại, hộ trì các căn, tiết độ trong ăn uống, chú tâm cảnh giác, tha thiết với hạnh Sa-môn, nhiệt thành tôn trọng Phật pháp, không sống trong sung túc, không biếng nhác, bỏ rơi gánh nặng về đọa lạc, dẫn đầu về viễn ly, tinh cần, tinh tấn, nỗ lực, chú tâm cảnh giác, định tâm, nhất tâm, có trí tuệ, không đần độn.
Những vị này sau khi nghe pháp môn này của Tôn giả Sariputta, hình như đang uống, hình như đang nếm với lời nói và tâm ý.
Thật lành thay, một vị Tôn giả đồng phạm hạnh đã khiến cho vượt khỏi bất thiện và an trú vào chánh thiện!
52

Này Hiền giả, ví như một người đàn bà hay người đàn ông, còn đang tuổi trẻ, tánh ưa trang sức, sau khi gội đầu xong, sau khi được một vòng hoa sen xanh hay một vòng vũ sanh hoa, hay một vòng thiện tư hoa, dùng hai tay cầm lấy vòng hoa ấy và đặt trên đỉnh đầu.
Này Hiền giả, cũng vậy những Thiện nam tử vì lòng tin đã xuất gia, từ bỏ gia đình sống không gia đình, không gian ngụy...
(như trên)...
Thật lành thay một Tôn giả đồng phạm hạnh đã khiến cho vượt khỏi bất thiện và an trú vào chánh thiện!
