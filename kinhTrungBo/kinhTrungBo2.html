At one time the World-Honored One was at Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika (Anathapindika).
While staying at that place, the World-Honored One called the monks:
"Hey monks!" --"World-Honored One", those monks answered the World-Honored One.
The Ton said:
"Monks, I will teach you the method to protect against all defilements."
Listen and pay careful attention.
I will say."
--"Yes, Venerable One."
The World-Honored One said as follows:

(Summary)

-- Monks, I preach the destruction of defilements for those who know, for those who see, not for those who do not know, for those who do not see.
And this, monks, what is the eradication of defilements for others to know and for others to see:
There is wise intention and there is not wise intention.
Monks, due to improper attention, the taints that have not yet arisen arise, and the cankers that have already arisen increase.
Monks, due to wise attention, the taints that have not yet arisen do not arise, and the cankers that have arisen are eliminated.
Monks, there are cankers that must be eliminated by knowledge, there are cankers that must be eliminated by protection, there are cankers that must be eliminated by receiving, there are cankers that must be eliminated by patience, there are cankers that must be eliminated by avoidance, there are cankers that must be eliminated by eradication, there are cankers that must be eliminated by practice.

(The defilements must be eliminated through knowledge)
9
598
2014
Monks, and what are the defilements that must be eliminated by knowledge?
Monks, here there are ordinary people who rarely hear, do not see the Saints, do not master the Dharma of the Saints, do not practice the Dharma of the Saints, do not see the Dharma of the Real Men, do not master the Dharma of the Real People, do not practice the Dharma of the Real People, do not understand the Dharma that requires attention, do not understand the Dharma that does not require attention;
Because he does not understand the dharmas that require attention, because he does not understand the dharmas that do not require attention, he pays attention to the dharmas that do not require attention and does not pay attention to the dharmas that require attention.
10
1030
3044
Monks, and what are the dharmas that do not require attention that he pays attention to?
Monks, it means that the dharma through his attention causes the cravings that have not yet arisen to arise, or the cravings that have already arisen to increase;
Either the unborn canker of existence arises, or the already arisen canker of existence increases, or the unborn canker of ignorance arises, or the already arisen canker of ignorance increases.
Those dharmas are dharmas that do not require attention, but he pays attention.
Monks, what are the dharmas that require attention that he does not pay attention to?
Monks, it means that through his mind the dharma of desire that has not yet arisen does not arise, or that the canker of desire that has arisen is eliminated, or that the canker of existence that has not yet arisen does not arise, or that the canker of existence that has already arisen is eliminated, or that the canker of ignorance that has not yet arisen does not arise, or that the canker of ignorance that has arisen is eliminated.
Those dharmas are dharmas that require attention but they do not pay attention.
Because he pays attention to dhammas that should not be noticed, because he does not pay attention to dhammas that need to be noticed, the cankers that have not yet arisen arise, and the cankers that have already arisen increase.
11
707
3751
He does not pay attention according to reason as follows:
"Was I present in the past, or was I not present in the past?
How did we exist in the past?
What was my appearance like when I was present in the past?
What were we before and how did we exist in the past?
Will I be present in the future or will I not be present in the future?
How will I be present in the future?
What will I look like in the future?
What was I before and how will I be in the future?" Or now he has doubts about himself in the present:
"Am I present or am I not present?
How am I present?
What kind of face and body do I have?
Where do these beings come from?
And then where will it go?".
12
1058
1058
For those who do not pay attention wisely, one of these six wrong views arises:
"I have a self", this wrong view arises to that person as real, as true;
"I have no self", this wrong view arises to him as real and true;
"Because of myself, I think I have a self", this wrong view arises to that person as real, as true;
"Because of myself, I think that I do not have a self", this wrong view arises to that person as real, as true.
"Not from myself, I think I have a self", this wrong view arises to that person as real, as true;
Or this wrong view arises in him:
"It is my self that speaks, feels, and enjoys the results of the good and evil karma done here and there. It is my self that is permanent, permanent, eternal, unchanging, and will exist forever."
Monks, such is called wrong view, forest view, wild view, argumentative view, dispute view, unlucky view.
Monks, bound by the fetters of views, ordinary people rarely hear that they cannot be liberated from birth, old age, death, sadness, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and grief.
I say that person cannot escape suffering.
13
466
1524
Monks, and the Holy disciples have heard a lot, seen the Saints, mastered the Dharma of the Saints, practiced the Dharma of the Saints;
to see the wise men, to master the dharma of the wise men, to practice the dharmas of the wise men, to understand the dharmas that require attention, to understand the dharmas that do not require attention.
This person, thanks to the knowledge of dharmas that require attention, through the knowledge of dharmas that do not require attention, does not pay attention to dharmas that do not require attention and heeds dharmas that require attention.
14
913
2437
And monks, what are the dharmas that do not require attention and this person does not pay attention?
Monks, whatever dharma is due to his attention that the craving that has not yet arisen arises, or that the craving that has already arisen increases;
or unborn emptiness...
(as above)...
Either the unborn cankers of ignorance are initiated, or the already born cankers of ignorance are growing.
Those are the dharmas that should not be attended to and he does not attend to them.
And monks, what are the dharmas that require attention and that one should pay attention to?
Monks, what are the dharmas that, due to his intention, do not give rise to the taint of desire that has not yet arisen, or that the canker of lust that has already arisen is eliminated, or that the canker of existence has not yet arisen...
(as above)...
or the unborn canker of ignorance does not arise, or the arisen canker of ignorance is eliminated, these are dharmas that need to be attended to and he must pay attention.
Thanks to him not paying attention to the dharmas that do not need attention, paying attention to the dharmas that need attention, the cankers that have not yet arisen do not arise and the cankers that have already arisen are eliminated.
15
324
2761
He is wise in his intention:
"This is suffering", as reasoned thinking:
"This is the origin of suffering", as reasoned thinking:
"This is the cessation of suffering", as reasoned thinking:
"This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering."
Thanks to that person's intention, the three fetters are eliminated:
personal views, doubts, and precepts prohibit attachment.
Monks, these dharmas are called defilements that must be eliminated by knowledge.
16
45
2806
(The defilements must be eliminated by protection)
17
959
3765
And monks, what are the defilements that must be eliminated by protection?
Here, there is a Bhikkhu who is wise and aware, living protectively with eye protection.
Monks, if that monk lives without protecting his eyes, harmful defilements and heat of the brain may arise.
If you live protectively with eye protection, those harmful defilements and brain heat will no longer exist.
He is like a wise watcher, living protectively with the protection of the ears...
(as above)...
live protectively with nostril protection...
(as above)...
live hedged with tongue guard...
(as above)...
Live like the sense of protection with self-protection...
(as above)...
Live like the sense of guarding and protecting with the guarding of the mind.
Monks, if that monk lives unprotected with protective intention, harmful defilements and heat of mind may arise.
If you live with protective intention, those destructive defilements and heat of the brain will no longer exist.
Monks, these dharmas are called defilements that must be eliminated by protection.
18
45
3810
(The defilements must be eliminated through use)
19
301
4111
And monks, what are the defilements that must be eliminated by use?
Monks, here, monks, as wisely observed, use clothes only to prevent cold, prevent heat, prevent the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, heat from the sun, and reptiles, only for the purpose of covering up nakedness.
20
387
387
He, like a wise observer, receives alms food not for fun, not for passion, not for adornment, not for self-beautification, but only so that this body may live long and be maintained, so that this body will not be harmed, in order to support the holy life, thinking:
"Thus, we eliminate old feelings and do not allow new feelings to arise, and we will have no mistakes and live in peace."
21
238
625
Such a person is like the wise sense of observation, using the sitting position, only to prevent cold, prevent heat, prevent the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, heat from the sun, and all kinds of reptiles, only to eliminate the dangers of the weather, only for the purpose of living alone and peacefully.
22
125
750
He is like a wise man who uses medicine to treat illness, just to stop the painful feelings that have arisen, in order to be completely free from suffering.
23
269
1019
Monks, if he does not take advantage of this, destructive cankers and heat of mind may arise.
If he takes advantage of it like that, those harmful defilements and heat will no longer exist.
Monks, these dharmas are called defilements that must be eliminated by use.
24
46
1065
(The defilements must be eliminated through patience)
25
703
1768
And monks, what are the defilements that must be eliminated through patience?
Monks, here, there is a monk who is wisely aware, patient with cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, the heat of the sun, and reptiles;
Be patient with defamatory statements.
He has the nature to endure the feelings of the body, the feelings of pain, sharpness, sharp pain, aching, not happy, not enjoyable, numbing.
Monks, if he does not have such patience, destructive cankers and heatstroke may arise.
If he is patient like that, those harmful defilements and heat will no longer exist.
Monks, these dharmas are called defilements that must be eliminated through patience.
26
45
1813
(The defilements must be eliminated by avoidance)
27
813
2626
And monks, what are the defilements that must be eliminated by avoidance?
Monks, here, a monk who is wisely aware avoids evil elephants, avoids evil horses, avoids evil cows, avoids evil dogs, snakes, logs, thorns, deep pits, mountain abysses, dirty ponds, and puddles.
There are seats that are not worthy of sitting, residences that should not be visited, evil friends that if they associate with, they will be doubted and despised by wise fellow monks;
He, like the wise watcher, avoids that unworthy seat, stays in that place, and should not visit that place and those cruel friends.
Monks, if he does not avoid it like that, those destructive defilements and heat of mind may arise.
If he avoids it like that, those harmful defilements and heat will no longer exist.
Monks, these dharmas are called cankers that must be eliminated by avoidance.
28
45
2671
(The defilements must be eliminated by eradication)
29
836
3507
And monks, what are the defilements that must be eliminated by elimination?
Monks, here, a monk who observes wisely does not accept the thoughts of desire that have arisen, abandons them, eliminates them, destroys them, does not allow them to exist;
not accepting the anger that has arisen, abandoning it, eliminating it, destroying it, not allowing it to exist (that anger);
not accepting harmful thoughts that have arisen, abandoning them, eliminating them, destroying them, not allowing them to exist (those harmful thoughts);
Do not accept the evil and unwholesome dharmas that always arise, abandon them, eliminate them, destroy them, and do not allow them to exist.
Monks, if he does not eliminate them in this way, those destructive defilements and heat of mind may arise.
If he eliminates it like that, those harmful defilements and heat of the brain will no longer exist.
Monks, these dharmas are called defilements that must be eliminated by elimination.
30
43
3550
(The defilements must be eliminated through practice)
31
740
740
And monks, what are the defilements that must be eliminated by practice?
Monks, here, a monk practices the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, this enlightenment factor abandons greed, abandons greed, destroys cessation, and leads to renunciation;
like the practice of investigating the dharma of enlightenment...
(as above)...
practice diligence and enlightenment...
What is the practice of practicing joy and enlightenment...
practice light peace and enlightenment...
practice concentration...
practice the enlightenment factor of renunciation;
This enlightenment of renunciation is renunciation, abandonment of greed, cessation, and the direction of renunciation.

Một thời Thế Tôn ở Savatthi (Xá-vệ), tại Jetavana (Kỳ-đà Lâm), vườn ông Anathapindika (Cấp Cô Ðộc).
Khi ở tại chỗ ấy, Thế Tôn gọi các Tỷ-kheo:
"Này các Tỷ-kheo!" --"Bạch Thế Tôn", các Tỷ-kheo ấy vâng đáp Thế Tôn.
Thế Tôn nói:
"Này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta sẽ giảng cho các Người pháp môn phòng hộ tất cả lậu hoặc".
Hãy nghe và khéo tác ý.
Ta sẽ nói".
--"Thưa vâng, bạch Thế Tôn".
Thế Tôn nói như sau:

(Tóm lược)

1371
-- Này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta giảng sự diệt tận các lậu hoặc cho người biết, cho người thấy, không phải cho người không biết, cho người không thấy.
Và này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là sự diệt tận các lậu hoặc cho người biết, cho người thấy:
có như lý tác ý và không như lý tác ý.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, do không như lý tác ý, các lậu hoặc chưa sanh được sanh khởi, và các lậu hoặc đã sanh được tăng trưởng.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, do như lý tác ý, các lậu hoặc chưa sanh không sanh khởi, và các lậu hoặc đã sanh được trừ diệt.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, có những lậu hoặc phải do tri kiến được đoạn trừ, có những lậu hoặc phải do phòng hộ được đoạn trừ, có những lậu hoặc phải do thọ dụng được đoạn trừ, có những lậu hoặc phải do kham nhẫn được đoạn trừ, có những lậu hoặc phải do tránh né được đoạn trừ, có những lậu hoặc phải do trừ diệt được đoạn trừ, có những lậu hoặc phải do tu tập được đoạn trừ.

(Các lậu hoặc phải do tri kiến được đoạn trừ)

Này các Tỷ-kheo, và thế nào là các lậu hoặc phải do tri kiến được đoạn trừ?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây có kẻ phàm phu ít nghe, không được thấy các bậc Thánh, không thuần thục pháp các bậc Thánh, không tu tập pháp các bậc Thánh, không được thấy các bậc Chơn nhơn, không thuần thục pháp các bậc Chơn nhơn, không tu tập pháp các bậc Chơn nhơn, không tuệ tri các pháp cần phải tác ý, không tuệ tri các pháp không cần phải tác ý;
vị này vì không tuệ tri các pháp cần phải tác ý, vì không tuệ tri các pháp không cần phải tác ý nên tác ý các pháp không cần phải tác ý và không tác ý các pháp cần phải tác ý.
10
1030
3044
Này các Tỷ-kheo, và thế nào là các pháp không cần phải tác ý mà vị ấy tác ý?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, nghĩa là các pháp do vị ấy tác ý mà dục lậu chưa sanh được sanh khởi, hay dục lậu đã sanh được tăng trưởng;
hay hữu lậu chưa sanh được sanh khởi, hay hữu lậu đã sanh được tăng trưởng, hay vô minh lậu chưa sanh được sanh khởi, hay vô minh lậu đã sanh được tăng trưởng.
Những pháp ấy là những pháp không cần phải tác ý mà vị ấy tác ý.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, và thế nào là các pháp cần phải tác ý mà vị ấy không tác ý?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, nghĩa là các pháp do vị ấy tác ý mà dục lậu chưa sanh không sanh khởi, hay dục lậu đã sanh được trừ diệt, hay hữu lậu chưa sanh không sanh khởi, hay hữu lậu đã sanh được trừ diệt, hay vô minh lậu chưa sanh không sanh khởi, hay vô minh lậu đã sanh được trừ diệt.
Những pháp ấy là những pháp cần phải tác ý mà các vị ấy không tác ý.
Do vị ấy tác ý các pháp không nên tác ý, do vị ấy không tác ý các pháp cần phải tác ý, nên các lậu hoặc chưa sanh được sanh khởi, và các lậu hoặc đã sanh được tăng trưởng.
11
707

Vị ấy không như lý tác ý như sau:
"Ta có mặt trong thời quá khứ, hay ta không có mặt trong thời quá khứ?
Ta có mặt trong thời quá khứ như thế nào?
Ta có mặt trong thời quá khứ hình vóc như thế nào?
Trước kia ta là gì và ta đã có mặt như thế nào trong thời quá khứ?
Ta sẽ có mặt trong thời vị lai hay ta sẽ không có mặt trong thời vị lai?
Ta sẽ có mặt trong thời vị lai như thế nào?
Ta sẽ có mặt trong thời vị lai, hình vóc như thế nào?
Trước kia ta là gì và ta sẽ có mặt như thế nào trong thời vị lai?" Hay nay vị ấy có nghi ngờ về mình trong thời hiện tại:
"Ta có mặt hay ta không có mặt?
Ta có mặt như thế nào?
Ta có mặt hình vóc như thế nào?
Chúng sanh này từ đâu đến?
Và rồi nó sẽ đi đâu?".
12
1058
1058
Với người không như lý tác ý như vậy, một trong sáu tà kiến này khởi lên:
"Ta có tự ngã", tà kiến này khởi lên với người ấy như thật, như chơn;
"Ta không có tự ngã", tà kiến này khởi lên với người ấy như thật như chơn;
"Do tự mình, ta tưởng tri ta có tự ngã", tà kiến này khởi lên với người ấy như thật, như chơn;
"Do tự mình, ta tưởng tri ta không có tự ngã", tà kiến này khởi lên với người ấy như thật, như chơn.
"Không do tự mình, ta tưởng tri ta có tự ngã", tà kiến này khởi lên với người ấy như thật, như chơn;
hay tà kiến này khởi lên với người ấy:
"Chính tự ngã của ta nói, cảm giác, hưởng thọ quả báo các nghiệp thiện ác đã làm chỗ này, chỗ kia, chính tự ngã ấy của ta là thường trú, thường hằng, hằng tồn, không chuyển biến, và sẽ vĩnh viễn tồn tại".
Này các Tỷ-kheo, như vậy gọi là tà kiến, kiến trù lâm, kiến hoang vu, kiến hý luận, kiến tranh chấp, kiến kiết phược.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, trói buộc bởi kiến kiết sử, kẻ phàm phu ít nghe không được giải thoát khỏi sanh, già, chết, sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não.
Ta nói kẻ ấy không thoát khỏi khổ đau.
13
466
1524
Này các Tỷ-kheo, và vị Thánh đệ tử nghe nhiều, được thấy các bậc Thánh, thuần thục pháp các bậc Thánh, tu tập pháp các bậc Thánh;

Và này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là các pháp không cần phải tác ý và vị này không tác ý?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, những pháp nào do vị ấy tác ý mà dục lậu chưa sanh được sanh khởi, hay dục lậu đã sanh được tăng trưởng;
hay hữu lậu chưa sanh...
(như trên)...
hay vô minh lậu chưa sanh được khởi, hay vô minh lậu đã sanh được tăng trưởng.
Ðó là những pháp không nên tác ý và vị ấy không tác ý.
Và này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là các pháp cần phải tác ý và vị ấy tác ý?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, những pháp nào do vị ấy tác ý mà dục lậu chưa sanh không sanh khởi, hay dục lậu đã sanh được trừ diệt, hay hữu lậu chưa sanh...

Vị ấy như lý tác ý:
"Ðây là khổ", như lý tác ý:
"Ðây là khổ tập", như lý tác ý:
"Ðây là khổ diệt", như lý tác ý:
"Ðây là con đường đưa đến khổ diệt".
Nhờ vị ấy tác ý như vậy, ba kiết sử được trừ diệt:

Vị ấy như lý giác sát, thọ dụng món ăn khất thực không phải để vui đùa, không phải để đam mê, không phải để trang sức, không phải để tự làm đẹp mình, mà chỉ để thân này được sống lâu và được bảo dưỡng, để thân này khỏi bị thương hại, để hỗ trợ phạm hạnh, nghĩ rằng:
