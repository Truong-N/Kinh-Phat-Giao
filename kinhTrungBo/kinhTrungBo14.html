14. Minor Sutra on Aggregates of Suffering
3
25
76
(Cùladukkhakkhanda sutta)
4
17
93
Thus I heard:
5
131
224
At one time, the World-Honored One lived among the Sakka family in the city of Kapilavatthu in the Nigrodha garden.
6
176
400
At that time, a Sakka named Mahànàma came to the place where the World-Honored One was staying. After arriving, he bowed to him and sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, Mahànàma, the Sakka family, said to the World-Honored One:
7
622
1022
-- World-Honored One, for a long time now, I have understood the World-Honored One's teachings like this:
"Greed is the defilement of the mind, anger is the defilement of the mind, ignorance is the defilement of the mind."
World-Honored One, I have understood the World-Honored One's teachings like this:
"Greed is the defilement of the mind, anger is the defilement of the mind, ignorance is the defilement of the mind."
However, sometimes the greedy dharmas occupy your mind and stay, the angry dharmas occupy your mind and stay, the delusions occupy your mind and stay.
World-Honored One, I think to myself:
"Which dharma within me cannot be eliminated? Therefore, the dharmas of greed enter my mind and reside, the dharmas of anger enter my mind and reside, the dharmas of ignorance enter my mind and reside?"
8
433
1455
-- Hey Mahànàma, there is a dharma in you that has not been eliminated, so the dharmas of greed enter your mind and stay, the dharmas of hatred enter your mind and stay, the dharmas of delusion enter your mind and stay.
And Mahànàma, that dharma in you can be eliminated, if you do not live in a family, if you do not enjoy desires.
And Mahànàma, because that dharma in you has not been eliminated, you live in a family and enjoy your desires.
9
622
2077
There are less desires and joys, more sufferings, more worries, and more dangers here.
Mahānāma, if a Noble disciple skillfully sees like this with true wisdom, but if he has not yet realized the joy and happiness that comes from separation from desire, separation from evil and unwholesome dharmas, or some other nobler dharma, then he is not yet free from the influence of desires.
Mahānāma, when will a wise disciple see like this with true wisdom:
"Less desires, less joy, more suffering, more anxiety.
The danger here is more", and this person realizes the joy and happiness that comes from separation from desires, separation from evil, unwholesome dharmas or some noble dharma, so he is not influenced by desires.
10
715
2792
Mahānāma, in the past, when I was still a Bodhisattva and had not attained Bodhi or attained Enlightenment, I skillfully saw with true wisdom:
"The pleasures of desire are less, the suffering is more, the mind is more, the danger here is more", even though I have seen such true wisdom, I have not yet realized the joy and happiness that comes from separation from desire, separation from evil and unwholesome dharmas or any other noble dharma.
And so I know that I am not yet free from being influenced by desires.
And, Mahànàma, when I see skillfully with true wisdom:
"Less desires, less joy, more suffering, more anxiety, more danger here", and I realize the joy and happiness that comes from separation from desire, separation from evil, unwholesome dharmas or some other noble dharma, so I am not influenced by desires.
11
535
3327
And Mahànàma, what is the sweetness of the senses?
Mahànàma, there are five dharmas that increase these desires:
Forms perceived by the eyes are likable, pleasant, agreeable, pleasing, compatible with desire, attractive;
sounds perceived by the ear...;
scents perceived by the nose...;
tastes perceived by the tongue...;
Contacts cognized by the body are likable, pleasurable, agreeable, pleasing, compatible with desire, attractive.
Mahànàma, there are five dharmas that increase such desires.
Mahānāma, based on these five dharmas that increase the desires, happiness and joy arise, such is the sweetness of the desires.
12
591
3918
And Mahànàma, what is the danger of sensual pleasures?
Here, Mahānāma, there are good men who earn their living by occupations such as counting on fingers, calculating, estimating, farming, trading, herding cows, archery, working for the king, or doing any other profession.
That person must endure cold, must endure heat, must endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, heat, sun, reptiles, and die of hunger and thirst.
Mahànàma, such is the danger of desires, practically present, belonging to the aggregate of suffering, taking desire as a cause, taking desire as a condition, is the origin of desire, is the cause of desire.
13
373
373
Mahānāma, if that good man makes such an effort, is so diligent, is so diligent, but those assets do not come to him, he laments, is sad and cries, beats his chest, and falls unconscious:
"Oh!
My efforts are truly in vain, my diligence is truly fruitless."
Such, Mahànàma, is the danger of sensual pleasures...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
14
779
1152
Mahānāma, if that good man makes such an effort, is so diligent, is so diligent, and those assets come to him, because he has to protect those assets, he feels pain and anxiety:
"How can kings not plunder them, how can thieves not plunder them, how can fire not burn them, water not sweep them away, or unworthy heirs not plundering them?" Even though he protects and preserves like that, kings still plunder those properties, thieves still plunder them, fires still burn them, water still sweeps them away or unworthy heirs still plunder them.
He lamented, was sad, cried, beat his chest, and lost consciousness:
"What once belonged to me, now I don't have it anymore."
Such, Mahànàma, is the danger of sensual pleasures...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
15
757
1909
Again, Mahānāma, with desire as the cause, with desire as the condition, with desire as the cause, with desire as the cause, kings compete with kings, Kshatriyas compete with Kshatriyas, Brahmans compete with Brahmins, householders compete with householders, mothers compete with children, children compete with mothers, fathers compete with children, children compete with fathers, brothers compete with brothers, brothers compete with sisters, older sisters compete. compete with you, friends compete with friends.
When they have engaged in dispute, debate, and contention;
they attack each other with their hands;
they attacked each other with stones;
they attacked each other with sticks;
They attacked each other with swords.
Here they go to death, to suffering almost to death.
Such, Mahànàma, is the danger of sensual pleasures...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
16
439
2348
Again, Mahānāma, desire is the cause...
motivated by righteous desire, they hold spears and shields, they carry bows and arrows, they are drawn up on both sides, and arrows are aimed at each other, swords are thrown at each other, swords are swung at each other.
They shot and stabbed each other with arrows, they threw and stabbed each other with swords, they beheaded each other with swords.
Here they go to death, to suffering almost to death.
Such, Mahànàma, is the danger of sensual pleasures...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
17
510
2858
Again, Mahānāma, desire is the cause...
They held spears and shields, they carried bows and arrows, they attacked citadels that had just been plastered with lime and arrows were aimed at each other, swords were thrown at each other, swords were swung at each other.
Here, they shot and stabbed each other with arrows, they stabbed each other with swords, they poured boiling dung water, they crushed each other with stones, they beheaded each other with swords.
Here they go to death, to suffering almost to death.
Such, Mahànàma, is the danger of sensual pleasures...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
18
1119
3977
Again, Mahānāma, desire is the cause...
motivated by government, they break into houses, they rob things, they act like robbers, they ambush main roads, they go to people's wives.
When kings caught such a person, they immediately applied many different punishments.
They beat with whips, they beat with sticks, they beat with sticks, they cut off hands, they cut off feet, they cut off limbs, they cut off ears, they cut off noses, they cut off ears and cut off noses, they use oil cauldron punishment, they use torture torture (cutting the top of the head into the shape of a scallop), they use mouth-shaped lahuu punishment...
Fire man shape (burning fire into a wreath)...
good luck (burning hands)...
execution area (take straw and braid it and tighten it)...
dress in shape (using tree bark to make clothes)...
antelope shape (mountain goat penalty)...
corporal punishment (hooking the meat with a hook)...
coin shape (cut meat into coin shape)...
shaped block...
transform...
high pedal station...
They watered them with boiling oil, they fed them to dogs, they staked the living, they cut off their heads with swords.
Here they go to death, to suffering almost to death.
Mahànàma, such is the danger of desire...
(as above)...
is the cause of desire.
19
475
475
Again, Mahānāma, desire is the cause...
With desire as the cause, they live doing evil deeds of body, doing evil deeds of speech, and doing evil deeds of mind.
Because they live doing evil deeds of the body, doing evil deeds of speech, doing evil deeds of the mind, when the body breaks down after death, they are reborn in evil realms, evil realms, lower realms, hell.
Mahànàma, such is the danger of desires, leading to future suffering, is the aggregate of suffering, caused by desire, caused by desire, caused by desire, caused by desire itself.

Mahànàma, at one time I was staying at Rajagaha, on Mount Gijjhakuta.
At that time, many Niganthas on the slopes of Isigili mountain, on Kalasila (Black Rock), stood up straight, refused to sit and felt painful, painful, fierce, sharp feelings.
Hey Mahànàma, then I got up from the solitary meditation in the afternoon and went to the slopes of Mount Isigili, at Kalasila where those Niganthas were staying. When I got there I said to those Niganthas:
"Friends, why do you stand up straight, refusing to sit down and feel such painful, painful, intense, sharp feelings?"
21
991
2070
Mahànàma, having said that, those Niganthas answered me as follows:
"Hey Sage, Nigantha Nataputta - is omniscient, omniscient, claiming to have omniscience as follows:
'Even if we walk, stand, sleep and wake up, knowledge always exists continuously in us'.
He said as follows:
'Hey Niganthas, if you have done evil karma in the past, make that karma disappear through this fierce austerity.
Not doing bad karma in the future is due to the protection of the body, the protection of speech, and the protection of the mind right in the present, right here.
Thus it is through burning, the cessation of past karma, the abstinence from new karma, that there is no future continuation.
Due to future discontinuity, karma is eliminated;
Because karma is eliminated, suffering is eliminated;
Because suffering is eliminated, feeling is eliminated;
Because feeling is eliminated, all suffering will be eliminated'.
And because we accept it, and we endure it, we are happy."
22
961
3031
Mahànàma, when I was told that, I said to those Niganthas as follows:
"Nigantha Sages, do you know, in the past, were you present or were you not present?" --"Sir, we don't know." -- "Nigantha Sages, do you know that in the past, you did not do bad karma or did you do bad karma?" --"Sir, we don't know." --"Nigantha Sages, do you know that you do not do karma like this or like that?" --"Sir, we don't know." --"Nigantha Sages, do you know:
Has this level of suffering been eliminated, what level of suffering needs to be eliminated?
Or, when this level of suffering has been eliminated, will all suffering be eliminated?" --"Sir, we don't know." --"Friends of Nigantha, do you know the present eradication of unwholesome dharmas and the achievement of wholesome dharmas?" --"Sir, we don't know."
23
817
3848
--"Friends, as you say, Nigantha you do not know:
In the past you were present or you were not present;
You do not know whether in the past you did not do bad karma or did do bad karma;
You don't know, you don't do bad karma like this or like that;
You do not know, this level of suffering has been eliminated, this level of suffering needs to be eliminated;
Once this level of suffering has been eliminated, all suffering will be eliminated;
You do not know, the present eradication of unwholesome dharmas and the accomplishment of wholesome dharmas.
Venerable Nigantha, if this is the case, those who hunt in this world, with bloody hands, doing cruel karma, are reborn in the human race, will those people become monks in the ranks of you Nigantha?"
24
311
4159
--"Sage Gotama, happiness cannot be achieved through happiness.
Happiness must be achieved through suffering.
Venerable Gotama, if happiness can be achieved through happiness, then King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara can achieve happiness, and King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara lives happier than Venerable Gotama.
25
533
533
"These words were actually spoken by Venerable Nigantha hastily, without thinking.
Sage Gotama, happiness cannot be achieved through happiness.
Happiness must be achieved through suffering.
Sage Gotama, if happiness can be achieved through happiness, then King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara can achieve happiness;
and King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara lived happier than Venerable Gotama.
And we ourselves here need to be asked the following:
'Among the Venerable Ones, who lived happier, King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara or Venerable Gotama?'
26
453
986
"Sage Gotama, these words were truly spoken by us hastily, without thinking:
Sage Gotama, happiness cannot be achieved through happiness, during the time of King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara happiness could be achieved;
and King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara lived happier than Venerable Gotama.
Let's leave things as they are.
Now we ask Venerable Gotama:
'Among you Venerable Ones, who lives happier, King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara or Venerable Gotama?'
27
319
1305
--"Friends of Nigantha, now I will ask you a question, the same issue.
If you please, answer that question.
Nigantha Sages, what do you think?
Can King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara not move his body, not say a word, live in the feeling of pure bliss for seven days and seven nights?
28
32
1337
--"Hey Sage, it's impossible.
29
305
1642
--"Nigantha Sages, what do you think?
Can King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara not move his body, not utter a word, live the feeling of pure bliss for six days and six nights, always five days and five nights, always four days and four nights, always three days and three nights, always two days and two nights, always one day and one night?
30
32
1674
--"Hey Sage, it's impossible.
31
546
2220
--"Friends of Nigantha, I can not move my body, not say a word, and live the feeling of pure bliss for one day and one night.
Venerable Nigantha, I can not move my body, not say a word, live the feeling of pure bliss always for two days and two nights, always for three days and three nights, always for four days and four nights, always for five days and five nights, always for six days and six nights, always for seven days and seven nights.
Nigantha Sages, what do you think?
The truth is, who lived happier, King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara or I?
32
87
2307
--"The fact is that, Venerable Gotama lived happier than King Magadha Seniya Bimbisara."
33
98
2405
The World-Honored One preached like that.
Mahànàma of the Sakka family rejoiced and accepted the Buddha's teachings.

(Cùladukkhakkhanda sutta)
4
17
93
Như vầy tôi nghe:
5
131
224
Một thời, Thế Tôn sống giữa giòng họ Sakka (Thích-ca), trong thành Kapilavatthu (Ca-tỳ-la-vệ) tại vườn Nigrodha (Ni-câu-luật Viên).
6
176
400
Lúc ấy, có người Sakka tên Mahànàma đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, sau khi đến xong, đảnh lễ Ngài rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, Mahànàma, dòng họ Sakka bạch Thế Tôn:
7
622
1022
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, đã lâu rồi, con đã hiểu như thế này lời dạy của Thế Tôn:
"Tham là cấu uế của tâm, sân là cấu uế của tâm, si là cấu uế của tâm".
Bạch Thế Tôn, con đã hiểu như thế này lời dạy của Thế Tôn:
"Tham là cấu uế của tâm, sân là cấu uế của tâm, si là cấu uế của tâm".
Tuy vậy, đôi lúc các tham pháp chiếm cứ tâm con và an trú, các sân pháp chiếm cứ tâm con và an trú, các si pháp chiếm cứ tâm con và an trú.
Bạch Thế Tôn, con tự suy nghĩ:
"Pháp nào tự trong ta không đoạn trừ được, do vậy các tham pháp xâm nhập tâm ta và an trú, các sân pháp xâm nhập tâm ta và an trú, các si pháp xâm nhập tâm ta và an trú?"
8
433
1455
-- Này Mahànàma, có một pháp trong Ông chưa được đoạn trừ, do vậy các tham pháp xâm nhập tâm Ông và an trú, các sân pháp xâm nhập tâm Ông và an trú, các si pháp xâm nhập tâm Ông và an trú.
Và này Mahànàma, pháp ấy trong Ông có thể đoạn trừ được, nếu Ông không sống trong gia đình, nếu Ông không thụ hưởng các dục vọng.
Và này Mahànàma, vì pháp ấy trong Ông chưa được đoạn trừ, nên Ông sống trong gia đình và thụ hưởng các dục vọng.
9
622
2077
Các dục vọng, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, sự nguy hiểm ở đây lại nhiều hơn.
Này Mahànàma, nếu một vị Thánh đệ tử khéo thấy như vậy với như thật chánh trí tuệ, nhưng nếu vị này chưa chứng được hỷ lạc do ly dục, ly ác bất thiện pháp sanh, hay một pháp nào khác cao thượng hơn, như vậy vị ấy chưa khỏi bị các dục chi phối.
Này Mahànàma, khi nào vị Thánh đệ tử khéo thấy như vậy với như thật chánh trí tuệ:
"Các dục, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều.
Sự nguy hiểm ở đây lại nhiều hơn", và vị này chứng được hỷ lạc do ly dục, ly ác bất thiện pháp sanh hay một pháp nào cao thượng hơn, như vậy vị ấy không bị các dục chi phối.
10
715
2792
Này Mahànàma, thuở xưa, khi Ta còn là Bồ-tát, chưa chứng được Bồ-đề, chưa thành Chánh Ðẳng Chánh Giác, Ta khéo thấy với như thật chánh trí tuệ:
"Các dục vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, sự nguy hiểm ở đây lại nhiều hơn", dầu Ta có thấy với như thật chánh trí tuệ như vậy, nhưng Ta chưa chứng được hỷ lạc do ly dục, ly ác bất thiện pháp sanh hay một pháp nào khác cao thượng hơn.
Và như vậy Ta biết rằng, Ta chưa khỏi bị các dục chi phối.
Và này Mahànàma, khi nào Ta khéo thấy với như thật chánh trí tuệ:
"Các dục, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, sự nguy hiểm ở đây lại nhiều hơn", và Ta chứng được hỷ lạc do ly dục, ly ác bất thiện pháp sanh hay một pháp nào khác cao thượng hơn, như vậy Ta khỏi bị các dục chi phối.
11
535
3327
Và này Mahànàma, thế nào là vị ngọt các dục?
Này Mahànàma, có năm pháp tăng trưởng các dục này:
Các sắc pháp do mắt nhận thức, khả ái, khả lạc, khả ý, khả hỷ, tương ưng với dục, hấp dẫn;
các tiếng do tai nhận thức...;
các hương do mũi nhận thức...;
các vị do lưỡi nhận thức...;
các xúc do thân nhận thức, khả ái, khả lạc, khả ý, khả hỷ, tương ưng với dục, hấp dẫn.
Này Mahànàma, có năm pháp tăng trưởng các dục như vậy.
Này Mahànàma, y cứ vào năm pháp tăng trưởng các dục này, có lạc và hỷ khởi lên, như vậy là vị ngọt các dục.
12
591
3918
Và này Mahànàma, thế nào là sự nguy hiểm các dục?
Ở đây, này Mahànàma, có thiện nam tử nuôi sống với nghề nghiệp, như đếm ngón tay, như tính toán, như ước toán, như làm ruộng, như buôn bán, như chăn bò, như bắn cung, như làm công cho vua, như làm một nghề nào khác.
Người ấy phải chống đỡ lạnh, phải chống đỡ nóng, phải chịu đựng sự xúc chạm của ruồi, muỗi, gió, sức nóng, mặt trời, các loài bò sát, bị chết đói chết khát.
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục, thiết thực hiện tại, thuộc khổ uẩn, lấy dục làm nhân, lấy dục làm duyên, là nguồn gốc của dục, là nguyên nhân của dục.
13
373
373
Này Mahànàma, nếu thiện nam tử ấy nỗ lực như vậy, tinh cần như vậy, tinh tấn như vậy, nhưng các tài sản ấy không được đến tay mình, vị ấy than vãn, buồn phiền khóc than, đấm ngực, mê man bất tỉnh:
"Ôi!
Sự nỗ lực của ta thật sự là vô ích, sự tinh cần của ta thật sự không kết quả".
Này Mahànàma, như vậy, là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
14
779
1152
Này Mahànàma, nếu thiện nam tử ấy nỗ lực như vậy, tinh cần như vậy, tinh tấn như vậy, và các tài sản ấy được đến tay mình, vì phải hộ trì các tài sản ấy, vị ấy cảm thọ sự đau khổ, ưu tư:
"Làm sao các vua chúa khỏi cướp đoạt chúng, làm sao trộm cướp khỏi cướp đoạt chúng, làm sao lửa khỏi đốt cháy, nước khỏi cuốn trôi, hay các kẻ thừa tự không xứng đáng khỏi cướp đoạt chúng?" Dầu vị ấy hộ trì như vậy, giữ gìn như vậy, vua chúa vẫn cướp đoạt các tài sản ấy, trộm cướp vẫn cướp đoạt, lửa vẫn đốt cháy, nước vẫn cuốn trôi hay các kẻ thừa tự không xứng đáng vẫn cướp đoạt chúng.
Vị ấy than vãn, buồn phiền, khóc than, đấm ngực, mê man bất tỉnh:
"Cái đã thuộc của ta, nay ta không có nữa".
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
15
757
1909
Lại nữa, này Mahànàma, do dục làm nhân, do dục làm duyên, do dục làm nguyên nhân, do chính dục làm nhân, vua tranh đoạt với vua, Sát-đế-lị tranh đoạt với Sát-đế-lị, Bà-la-môn tranh đoạt với Bà-la-môn, gia chủ tranh đoạt với gia chủ, mẹ tranh đoạt với con, con tranh đoạt với mẹ, cha tranh đoạt với con, con tranh đoạt với cha, anh em tranh đoạt với anh em, anh tranh đoạt với chị, chị tranh đoạt với anh, bạn bè tranh đoạt với bạn bè.
Khi họ đã dấn mình vào tranh chấp, tranh luận, tranh đoạt;
họ công phá nhau bằng tay;
họ công phá nhau bằng đá;
họ công phá nhau bằng gậy;
họ công phá nhau bằng kiếm.
Ở đây họ đi đến tử vong, đi đến sự đau khổ gần như tử vong.
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
16
439
2348
Lại nữa, này Mahànàma, do dục làm nhân...
do chính dục làm nhân, họ cầm mâu và thuẫn, họ đeo cung và tên, họ dàn trận hai mặt, và tên được nhắm bắn nhau, đao được quăng ném nhau, kiếm được vung chém nhau.
Họ bắn đâm nhau bằng tên, họ quăng đâm nhau bằng đao, họ chặt đầu nhau bằng kiếm.
Ở đây họ đi đến tử vong, đi đến sự đau khổ gần như tử vong.
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
17
510
2858
Lại nữa, này Mahànàma, do dục làm nhân...
do chính dục làm nhân, họ cầm mâu và thuẫn, họ đeo cung và tên, họ công phá thành quách mới trét vôi hồ và tên được nhắm bắn nhau, đao được quăng ném nhau, kiếm được vung chém nhau.
Ở đây, họ bắn đâm nhau bằng tên, họ quăng đâm nhau bằng đao, họ đổ nước phân sôi, họ đè bẹp nhau bằng đá, họ chặt đầu nhau bằng kiếm.
Ở đây họ đi đến tử vong, đi đến sự đau khổ gần như tử vong.
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
18
1119
3977
Lại nữa, này Mahànàma, do dục làm nhân...
do chính dục làm nhân, họ đột nhập nhà cửa, họ cướp giật đồ đạc, họ hành động như kẻ cướp, họ phục kích các đường lớn, họ đi đến vợ người.
Các vua chúa khi bắt được một người như vậy liền áp dụng nhiều hình phạt sai khác.
Họ đánh bằng roi, họ đánh bằng gậy, họ đánh bằng côn, họ chặt tay, họ chặt chân, họ chặt tay chân, họ xẻo tai, họ cắt mũi, họ xẻo tai cắt mũi, họ dùng hình phạt vạc dầu, họ dùng hình phạt bối đồi hình (xẻo đỉnh đầu thành hình con sò), họ dùng hình phạt la hầu khẩu hình...
Hỏa man hình (lấy lửa đốt thành vòng hoa)...
chúc thủ hình (đốt tay)...
khu hành hình (lấy rơm bện lại rồi siết chặt)...
bì y hình (lấy vỏ cây làm áo)...
linh dương hình (hình phạt con dê núi)...

tiền hình (cắt thịt thành hình đồng tiền)...
khối trấp hình...
chuyển hình...
cao đạp đài...
họ tưới bằng dầu sôi, họ cho chó ăn, họ đóng cọc những người sống, họ lấy gươm chặt đầu.
Ở đây họ đi đến tử vong, đi đến sự đau khổ gần như tử vong.
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm của dục...
(như trên)...
là nguyên nhân của dục.
19
475
475
Lại nữa, này Mahànàma, do dục làm nhân...
do chính dục làm nhân, họ sống làm các ác hạnh về thân, làm các ác hạnh về lời nói, làm các ác hạnh về ý.
Do họ sống làm các ác hạnh về thân, làm các ác hạnh về lời nói, làm các ác hạnh về ý, khi thân hoại mạng chung, họ sanh vào cõi dữ, ác thú, đọa xứ, địa ngục.
Này Mahànàma, như vậy là sự nguy hiểm các dục, đưa đến đau khổ tương lai, là khổ uẩn, do dục làm nhân, do dục làm duyên, do dục làm nhân duyên, do chính dục làm nhân.

Này Mahànàma, một thời Ta ở tại Rajagaha (Vương Xá), trên núi Gijjhakuta (Linh Thứu).
Lúc bấy giờ, rất nhiều Nigantha (Ni-kiền Tử) tại sườn núi Isigili, trên Kalasila (Hắc Nham), đứng thẳng người, không chịu ngồi và cảm giác những cảm thọ thống thiết, khổ đau, khốc liệt, bén nhạy.
Này Mahànàma, rồi Ta vào buổi chiều, từ Thiền tịnh độc cư đứng dậy, đi đến sườn núi Isigili, tại Kalasila chỗ các Nigantha ấy ở, khi đến nơi Ta nói với các Nigantha ấy:
"Chư Hiền, tại sao các Ngươi lại đứng thẳng người, không chịu ngồi xuống và cảm giác những cảm thọ thống thiết, khổ đau, khốc liệt, bén nhạy như vậy?"

Này Mahànàma, được nói vậy các Nigantha ấy trả lời Ta như sau:
"Này Hiền giả, Nigantha Nataputta - là bậc toàn tri, toàn kiến, tự xưng là có tri kiến toàn diện như sau:
'Dầu ta có đi, có đứng, có ngủ và có thức, tri kiến luôn luôn được tồn tại liên tục ở nơi ta'.
Vị ấy nói như sau:
'Này các Nigantha, nếu xưa kia Ngươi có làm ác nghiệp, hãy làm cho nghiệp ấy tiêu mòn bằng khổ hạnh khốc liệt này.
Sự không làm ác nghiệp trong tương lai chính do sự hộ trì về thân, sự hộ trì về lời nói, sự hộ trì về ý ngay trong hiện tại, ở tại nơi đây.
Như vậy chính nhờ sự thiêu đốt, sự chấm dứt các nghiệp quá khứ, sự không làm các nghiệp mới, mà không có sự tiếp tục trong tương lai.
Do sự không tiếp tục trong tương lai, các nghiệp được diệt trừ;
do nghiệp được diệt trừ, khổ được diệt trừ;
do khổ được diệt trừ, cảm thọ được diệt trừ;
do cảm thọ được diệt trừ, tất cả khổ đau sẽ được tiêu mòn'.
Và vì chúng tôi chấp nhận điều ấy, và chúng tôi kham nhẫn điều ấy, nên chúng tôi được hoan hỷ."

Này Mahànàma, khi được nói vậy Ta nói với các Nigantha ấy như sau:
"Chư Hiền Nigantha, các Ngươi có biết chăng, trong quá khứ, các Ngươi có mặt hay các Ngươi không có mặt?" --"Thưa Hiền giả, chúng tôi không biết." --" Chư Hiền Nigantha, các Ngươi có biết chăng, trong quá khứ, các Ngươi không làm ác nghiệp hay có làm ác nghiệp?" --"Thưa Hiền giả, chúng tôi không biết." --"Chư Hiền Nigantha, các Ngươi có biết chăng, các Ngươi không làm các nghiệp như thế này hay như thế kia?" --"Thưa Hiền giả, chúng tôi không biết." --"Chư Hiền Nigantha, các Ngươi có biết chăng:
Mức độ đau khổ như thế này đã trừ diệt, mức độ đau khổ như thế này cần phải trừ diệt?
Hay, khi mức độ đau khổ như thế này đã được trừ diệt, thời tất cả đau khổ sẽ được trừ diệt?" --"Thưa Hiền giả, chúng tôi không biết." --"Chư Hiền Nigantha, các Ngươi có biết chăng, sự đoạn trừ ngay trong hiện tại các bất thiện pháp và sự thành tựu các thiện pháp?" --"Thưa Hiền giả, chúng tôi không biết."

--"Chư Hiền, theo các Ngươi nói, Nigantha các Ngươi không biết:
Trong quá khứ các Ngươi có mặt hay các Ngươi không có mặt;
các Ngươi không biết, trong quá khứ các Ngươi không làm các ác nghiệp hay có làm các ác nghiệp;
các Ngươi không biết, các Ngươi không làm ác nghiệp như thế này hay như thế kia;
các Ngươi không biết, mức độ đau khổ như thế này đã được trừ diệt, mức độ đau khổ như thế này cần phải trừ diệt;
mức độ đau khổ như thế này đã được trừ diệt thời tất cả đau khổ sẽ được trừ diệt;
các Ngươi không biết, sự đoạn trừ ngay trong hiện tại các bất thiện pháp và sự thành tựu các thiện pháp.
Chư Hiền Nigantha, sự kiện là như vậy thì những kẻ săn bắn ở đời, với bàn tay đẫm máu, làm các nghiệp hung dữ, được tái sanh trong loài người, những hạng ấy có xuất gia trong hàng ngũ Nigantha các Ngươi không?"

--"Hiền giả Gotama, hạnh phúc không có thể thành tựu nhờ hạnh phúc.
Hạnh phúc phải thành tựu nhờ đau khổ.
Hiền giả Gotama, nếu hạnh phúc có thể thành tựu nhờ hạnh phúc thì vua Magadha Seniya Bimbisara (Tần-bà-ta-la) có thể đạt được hạnh phúc, và vua Magadha Seniya Bimbisara sống hạnh phúc hơn Tôn giả Gotama.

Hiền giả Gotama, nếu hạnh phúc có thể thành tựu nhờ hạnh phúc, thời vua Magadha Seniya Bimbisara có thể đạt được hạnh phúc;
và vua Magadha Seniya Bimbisara sống hạnh phúc hơn Tôn giả Gotama.
Và chính ta ở đây cần phải được hỏi như sau:
'Giữa các bậc Tôn Giả, ai sống hạnh phúc hơn, vua Magadha Seniya Bimbisara hay Tôn giả Gotama?'

Nếu các Ngươi vui lòng, hãy trả lời câu hỏi ấy.
Chư Hiền Nigantha, các Ngươi nghĩ thế nào?
Vua Magadha Seniya Bimbisara có thể không di động thân thể, không nói lên một tiếng, sống cảm giác thuần túy lạc thọ luôn bảy ngày bảy đêm có được không?
