(Madhupindika sutta)

I heard this:
5
113
197
At one time, the World-Honored One lived among the Sakka family, at Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodharama garden.
6
270
467
Then in the morning, the World-Honored One, dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kapilavatthu to beg for alms.
After begging for alms at Kapilavatthu, when he finished eating, on the way back from begging for alms, the World-Honored One went to Dai Lam to rest for lunch.
After entering the Dai Lam forest, he sat down to rest under the beluvalatthika tree.
7
363
830
There was the Hand-held Stick (Dandapani) Sakka (Shakya), walking everywhere, wandering around the world, arriving at the Dai Lam forest, going deep into the forest, arriving at Beluvalatthika where the World-Honored One lived. When he arrived, he said friendly greetings, then stood on one side, leaning on the stick, standing on one side.
Sakka, the stick in hand, said to the Blessed One:
"What are the views of monks and what do they preach?"
8
417
1247
--"Hey Sage, according to My teachings, in the world with the Devas, Maras and Brahmas, with the Samanas, Brahmins, Devas and Humans, there is no one in this world arguing;
Thoughts will not haunt the Brahman who lives free from the hindrances of desire, free from doubts and hesitations, with all regrets destroyed, free from craving for existence and non-existence.
Hey Sage, such is my opinion, such is my teaching."
9
105
1352
Upon hearing that, Sakka the Stick in Hand shook his head, licked his tongue, with three wrinkles on his forehead, leaned on the stick and walked away.
10
160
1512
Then, in the afternoon, the World-Honored One rose from solitary meditation, went to Nigrodha garden, and when he arrived, sat on the prepared seat.
After sitting, the World-Honored One called the monks:
11
1190
2702
-- Monks, here, I entered Kapilavatthu in the morning, put on my robes, took my robe and bowl, and entered Kapilavatthu for alms.
After begging for alms in Kapilavatthu, after eating, on the way back from begging for alms, I went to Dai Lam to rest for lunch.
After entering the Dai Lam forest, I sat down to rest under the beluvalatthika tree.
There was a stick holding Sakka's hand, walking everywhere, traveling around the world, arriving at the Dai Lam forest, going deep into the forest, arriving at Beluvalatthika where I was staying, when he finished arriving, saying friendly greetings, then standing to one side, leaning on the stick.
Standing to one side, Sakka held the stick in his hand and said to me as follows:
"What are the views of monks and what do they preach?" Bhikkhus, having been told that, I replied to the Sakka Hand-held Stick:
"Friend, according to my teachings, in the world with the Devas, Maras, and Brahmas, with the Samanas, Brahmins, Devas, and Humans, there is no one in this world arguing.
Thoughts will not haunt the Brahman who lives free from the hindrances of desire, without doubts and hesitations, with all regrets destroyed, without craving for existence and non-existence.
Hey Sage, such is my opinion, such is my teaching."
Upon hearing that, Sakka the Stick in Hand shook his head, licked his tongue, with three wrinkles on his forehead, leaned on the stick and walked away.
12
43
2745
Upon hearing this, a monk told the World-Honored One:
13
359
3104
-- But World-Honored One, what is that teaching that the World-Honored One, in the world with the Devas, Maras and Brahmas, with the Samanas, Brahmins, Devas and Humans, did not argue with anyone in the world?
Wouldn't thoughts haunt the World-Honored One, who lived without the hindrances of desire, without doubts and hesitations, with all regrets destroyed, without craving for existence and non-existence?
14
549
3653
-- Monks, due to any cause or condition, some delusions and delusions haunt a person.
If here there is nothing worth rejoicing, worth celebrating, worth clinging to, then such is the cessation of the tendency of greed, the cessation of the tendency of anger, the cessation of the tendency of view, the cessation of the tendency of doubt, the cessation of the tendency of arrogance, the cessation of the tendency of greed for existence, the cessation of the tendency of ignorance, the cessation of clinging to beliefs, grasping at swords, fighting, avoiding conflict, argumentation, resistance, separation of broken language, false speech.
It is here that all these evil and unwholesome dharmas are destroyed, leaving no residue.
15
96
3749
The World-Honored One preached like that.
After saying that, Thien Thap stood up from his seat and entered the monastery.
16
813
813
Not long after the World-Honored One left, those monks thought:
"Friends, the World-Honored One, after giving us this summary teaching, without explaining the meaning extensively, rose from his seat and entered the monastery:
"Monks, due to any cause or condition...
there is no residue left."
Now who can widely explain the meaning of the teaching that the World-Honored One spoke briefly, and did not explain the meaning clearly?
Then those monks thought:
"Now there is Venerable Mahakaccana (Great Ca-chan-dien) who is praised by the World-Honored One and respected by his wise companions.
Venerable Mahakaccana can widely explain the meaning of this teaching that the World-Honored One spoke briefly, and did not explain the meaning clearly.
So let's go to where Venerable Mahakaccana lives, and after arriving, we will ask Venerable Mahakaccana what this means."
17
234
1047
Then those Bhikkhus went to the place where Venerable Mahakaccana was staying. After arriving, they said congratulations, asked politely to Venerable Mahakaccana and then sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, those monks said to Venerable Mahakaccana:
18
203
1250
-- "Friend, the World-Honored One, after speaking this summary teaching without clearly explaining its meaning, rose from his seat and entered the monastery:
"Monks, due to any cause or condition...
there is no residue left."
19
785
2035
Venerable Mahakaccana, when the World-Honored One had not been gone for long, we thought:
"Friends, the World-Honored One, after giving us this brief teaching...
entered the monastery: "Due to any cause...
there is no residue left."
Who can widely explain the meaning of the teachings that the World-Honored One spoke briefly...
do not clearly explain the meaning?" Hey Sage Mahakaccana, then we thought:
"Now the Venerable Mahakaccana is praised by the Blessed One and respected by his wise companions. The Venerable Mahakaccana can widely explain the meaning of the teaching spoken by the Blessed One briefly and without clearly explaining the meaning.
So let's go to where Venerable Mahakaccana lives. After arriving, let's ask Venerable Mahakaccana what this means.
Venerable Mahakaccana will explain."
20
722
2757
-- Venerable monks, it is like a person who loves tree cores, searches for tree cores, goes everywhere looking for tree cores, and comes to a large, upright tree with cores.
This person ignores the roots and the trunk, thinking that he must find the core of the tree in the branches and leaves.
The same is the action of the Venerable Ones, standing in front of the World-Honored One, you ignore the World-Honored One, thinking that you must ask me about this meaning.
Venerable Ones, the Blessed One knows what needs to be known, sees what needs to be seen, He has become the one with eyes, the one with wisdom, the Dharma, the Brahma, the preacher, the speaker, the bringer of goals, the giver of immortality, the Lord of Dharma, the Tathagata.
You must ask the Buddha the meaning of this at any time.
Whatever the World-Honored One explains to you, you should accept and maintain it.
21
712
3469
-- Sage Mahakaccana, surely the Blessed One knows what needs to be known, sees what needs to be seen, He has become the one with eyes, the one with wisdom, the Dharma, the Brahma, the preacher, the speaker, the bringer of goals, the giver of immortality, the Lord of Dharma, the Tathagata.
We must ask the Buddha the meaning of this at any time.
Whatever the World-Honored One explains to us, we will accept and maintain it.
But the Venerable Mahakaccana was praised by the World-Honored One and respected by his wise companions.
The Venerable Mahakaccana was able to widely explain the meaning of the teachings given by the World-Honored One briefly and without clearly explaining the meaning.
I hope Venerable Mahakaccana will explain without any disrespect.
22
53
3522
-- So, dear friends, please listen and pay attention carefully, I will explain.
23
23
3545
-- Yes, Sage.
24
80
3625
Those monks responded to Venerable Mahakaccana.
Venerable Mahakaccana preached as follows:
25
286
3911
-- Venerable Ones, the World-Honored One briefly stated this teaching...
and entered the monastery:
"Monks, no matter what cause or condition...
there is no residue left."
Venerable monks, the teachings were given by the World-Honored One briefly, and the meaning was not clearly explained.
I fully understand the meaning as follows:
26
378
378
Dear Venerables, due to the eye and the physical phenomena, eye consciousness arises.
The meeting of these three dharmas is contact.
Because of contact, there is feeling.
What has feeling, there is perception, what has perception, there is thinking, what has thinking, there is reasoning.
Because of that speculation, a number of false delusions haunt a person, regarding the physical phenomena perceived by the eyes, past, future and present.
27
549
927
Dear Venerables, due to the ear and sounds, ear consciousness arises, due to the nostrils and scents, nose consciousness arises, due to the tongue and tastes, tongue consciousness arises, due to the body and contact, body consciousness arises;
Due to human intention and dharmas, consciousness arises.
The meeting of these three dharmas is contact.
Due to contact, there are feelings.
What has feeling then has perception.
Whatever there is thought, there is contemplation.
What there is speculation, there is speculation.
Because of that speculation, some delusional speculations haunt a person, regarding the dharmas perceived by consciousness, past, future and present.
28
547
1474
Dear Venerables, this event happened:
Whenever there is an eye, whenever there is form, whenever there is eye consciousness, the essence of contact is revealed.
This event occurs:
Whenever there is the essence of contact, the essence of feeling is revealed.
This event occurs:
When there is the essence of feeling, the essence of perception is revealed.
This event occurs:
Whenever there is the reality of thought, the reality of contemplation is revealed.
This event occurs:
When there is the reality of contemplation, the reality of obsession is revealed.
29
446
1920
This event occurs:
When are there ears, when are there sounds, when are there ear consciousness...
This event occurs:
When there are nostrils, when there are scents, when there is nose consciousness...
This event happens when there is a tongue, when there are tastes, when there is real consciousness...
This event occurs:
When is there a body, when is there contact, when is there body consciousness...
This event occurs:
Whenever there is intention, whenever there are dharmas, whenever there is consciousness, the reality of contact is revealed.
30
604
2524
Dear Venerables, this event did not happen:
When there is no eye, when there are no forms, when there is no eye-consciousness, the essence of contact is revealed.
This event does not occur:
When there is no essence of contact, the essence of feeling is revealed.
This event does not occur:
When there is no reality of feeling, the reality of perception is revealed.
This event does not occur:
When there is no reality of thought, the reality of contemplation is revealed.
This event does not occur:
When there is no reality of contemplation, the reality of obsession with some delusional theories is revealed.
31
382
2906
Dear Venerables, this event did not happen:
when there are no ears, when there are no sounds...
When there is no nose, when there are no scents...
When is there no tongue, when is there no taste...
When there is no body, when there are no emotions...
This event does not occur:
When there is no mind, when there are no dharmas, when there is no consciousness, the essence of contact is revealed...
32
435
3341
Venerable Ones, World-Honored One, after briefly stating the teachings...
entered the monastery:
"Monks, due to any cause or condition...
no residue".
Dear Venerables, regarding this teaching that the World-Honored One spoke briefly, and the meaning was not explained extensively, I have understood the meaning in such a broad way.
If you want, go to where the World-Honored One lives, and after arriving, ask what this means.
Whatever the World-Honored One's answer is, accept and uphold it.
33
216
3557
Then those Bhikkhus, rejoicing and rejoicing in what the Venerable Mahakaccana said, rose from their seats and went to the place where the World-Honored One was. After coming to pay homage to him, they sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, those monks said to the World-Honored One:
34
1721
1721
-- World-Honored One, the World-Honored One gave us this teaching briefly...
entered the monastery.
"Monks, due to any cause or condition...
there is no residue left."
Not long after the World-Honored One left, we thought as follows:
"Friends, the World-Honored One, after giving us this summary teaching, without explaining the meaning extensively, rose from his seat and entered the monastery:
"Bhikkhu, due to whatever cause and effect, some delusional speculations haunt a person, if there is nothing here worth rejoicing, worth celebrating, worth clinging to, then such is the cessation of the tendency to greed, the cessation of the tendency to anger, the cessation of the tendency to view, the cessation of doubt, the cessation of arrogance, the cessation of greed for existence, the cessation of the continence of ignorance, the cessation of clinging to the stick, to the sword, to fighting, to avoid fighting, to argument. fighting, resisting fighting, separating language, false language.
It is here that all these evil and unwholesome dharmas are destroyed, leaving no residue."
Who can now explain widely the meaning of this teaching that the World-Honored One spoke briefly and without clearly explaining the meaning? Buddha, and we think:
"Now there is the Venerable Mahakaccana, who is praised by the World-Honored One and respected by his wise companions.
The Venerable Mahakaccana can widely explain the meaning of this teaching which the World-Honored One spoke briefly and without clearly explaining the meaning.
So let's go to where Venerable Mahakaccana lives, and after arriving, we will ask Venerable Mahakaccana what this means."
World-Honored One, then we went to where Venerable Mahakaccana lived. After arriving, we asked Venerable Mahakaccana the meaning of this.
World-Honored One, Venerable Mahakaccana has explained that meaning to us with these methods, with these sentences, with these writings.
35
251
1972
-- Monks, Venerable Mahakaccana is a wise man.
Monks, Venerable Mahakaccana is a person of Great Wisdom.
Monks, if you ask me the meaning of this, I will answer as Mahakaccana did.
This is the righteousness of that teaching, so accept and uphold it.
36
46
2018
When he heard that, Venerable Ananda told the World-Honored One:
37
401
2419
-- World-Honored One, like a hungry and tired person who finds a honey cake, with each bite he tastes, with each bite he enjoys the purest sweetness.
World-Honored One, in the same way, a Bhikkhu has exceptional knowledge, every time he ponders the meaning of this method with wisdom, every time he can enjoy the joy, enjoy the comfort of mind.
World-Honored One, what is the name of this method?
38
99
2518
-- Therefore, Ananda, this method is called the secret method.
Please accept it like this!
39
83
2601
The World-Honored One preached like that.
Venerable Ananda was delighted and believed in the Buddha's teachings.

Tôi nghe như vầy:
5
113
197
Một thời, Thế Tôn sống giữa các vị dòng họ Sakka (Thích-ca), tại Kapilavatthu (Ca-tỳ-la-vệ), ở vườn Nigrodharama.
6
270
467
Rồi Thế Tôn vào buổi sáng, đắp y, cầm y bát vào thành Kapilavatthu để khất thực.
Sau khi khất thực ở Kapilavatthu, khi ăn xong, trên đường khất thực trở về, Thế Tôn đi đến Ðại Lâm để nghỉ trưa.
Sau khi vào rừng Ðại Lâm, Ngài ngồi nghỉ trưa dưới gốc cây beluvalatthika.
7
363
830
Có vị Gậy cầm tay (Dandapani) Sakka (Thích-ca), kéo bộ khắp nơi, ngao du thiên hạ, đến tại rừng Ðại Lâm, đi sâu vào ngôi rừng, đến tại Beluvalatthika chỗ Thế Tôn ở, khi đến xong nói lên những lời hỏi thăm xã giao thân hữu, rồi đứng một bên, dựa trên cây gậy, đứng một bên.
Gậy cầm tay Sakka nói với Thế Tôn:
"Sa-môn có quan điểm thế nào, giảng thuyết những gì?"
8
417
1247
--"Này Hiền giả, theo lời dạy của Ta, trong thế giới với chư Thiên, Mara và Phạm thiên, với các chúng Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn, chư Thiên và loài Người, không có tranh luận một ai ở đời;
các tưởng sẽ không ám ảnh vị Bà-la-môn sống không bị dục triền phược, không có nghi ngờ do dự, với mọi hối quá đoạn diệt, không có tham ái đối với hữu và phi hữu.
Này Hiền giả, như vậy là quan điểm của Ta, như vậy là lời Ta giảng dạy".
9
105
1352
Khi nghe nói vậy, Gậy cầm tay Sakka lắc đầu, liếm lưỡi, với trán nổi lên ba đường nhăn, chống gậy rồi đi.
10
160
1512
Rồi Thế Tôn vào buổi chiều từ Thiền tịnh độc cư đứng dậy, đi đến vườn Nigrodha, khi đến xong, ngồi trên chỗ đã soạn sẵn.
Sau khi ngồi, Thế Tôn gọi các Tỷ-kheo:
11
1190
2702
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, Ta vào buổi sáng, đắp y, cầm y bát vào thành Kapilavatthu để khất thực.
Sau khi khất thực ở Kapilavatthu, ăn xong, trên đường khất thực trở về, Ta đi đến Ðại Lâm để nghỉ trưa.
Sau khi vào rừng Ðại Lâm, Ta ngồi nghỉ trưa dưới gốc cây beluvalatthika.
Có vị Gậy cầm tay Sakka kéo bộ khắp nơi, ngao du thiên hạ, đến tại rừng Ðại Lâm, đi sâu vào ngôi rừng, đến tại Beluvalatthika chỗ Ta ở, khi đến xong, nói lên những lời hỏi thăm xã giao thân hữu, rồi đứng một bên, dựa trên cây gậy.
Ðứng một bên, Gậy cầm tay Sakka nói với Ta như sau:
"Sa-môn có quan điểm thế nào, giảng thuyết những gì?" Chư Tỷ-kheo, được nói vậy, Ta trả lời Gậy cầm tay Sakka:
"Này Hiền giả, theo lời Ta dạy trong thế giới với chư Thiên, Mara, và Phạm thiên, với các chúng Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn, chư Thiên và loài Người, không có tranh luận một ai ở đời.
Các tưởng sẽ không ám ảnh vị Bà-la-môn sống không bị dục triền phược, không có nghi ngờ do dự, với mọi hối quá đoạn diệt, không có tham ái đối với hữu và phi hữu.
Này Hiền giả, như vậy là quan điểm của Ta, như vậy là lời Ta giảng dạy".
Khi nghe nói vậy, Gậy cầm tay Sakka lắc đầu, liếm lưỡi, với trán nổi lên ba đường nhăn, chống gậy rồi đi.
12
43
2745
Khi nghe nói vậy, một Tỷ-kheo bạch Thế Tôn:
13
359
3104
-- Nhưng bạch Thế Tôn, lời dạy ấy là gì mà Thế Tôn, trong thế giới với chư Thiên, Mara và Phạm thiên, với các chúng Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn, chư Thiên và loài Người, không có tranh luận một ai ở đời?
Các tưởng sẽ không ám ảnh Thế Tôn, vị đã sống không bị dục triền phược, không có nghi ngờ do dự, với mọi hối quá đoạn diệt, không có tham ái đối với hữu và phi hữu?
14
549
3653
-- Này Tỷ-kheo, do bất cứ nhân duyên gì, một số hý luận vọng tưởng ám ảnh một người.
Nếu ở đây không có gì đáng tùy hỷ, đáng đón mừng, đáng chấp thủ, thời như vậy là sự đoạn tận tham tùy miên, sự đoạn tận sân tùy miên, sự đoạn tận kiến tùy miên, sự đoạn tận nghi tùy miên, sự đoạn tận mạn tùy miên, sự đoạn tận hữu tham tùy miên, sự đoạn tận vô minh tùy miên, sự đoạn tận chấp trượng, chấp kiếm, đấu tranh, tránh tranh, luận tranh, kháng tranh, ly gián ngữ, vọng ngữ.
Chính ở đây, những ác, bất thiện pháp này đều được tiêu diệt, không còn dư tàn.
15
96
3749
Thế Tôn thuyết giảng như vậy.
Sau khi nói vậy, Thiện Thệ từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy bước vào tịnh xá.
16
813
813
Sau khi Thế Tôn đi chẳng bao lâu, các Tỷ-kheo ấy suy nghĩ:
"Chư Hiền, Thế Tôn sau khi nói lên lời dạy tóm tắt này cho chúng ta, không giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa, từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy và đã đi vào tịnh xá:
"Này Tỷ-kheo, do bất cứ nhân duyên gì...
không còn dư tàn".
Nay ai có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt, và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa".
Rồi những Tỷ-kheo ấy suy nghĩ:
"Nay có Tôn giả Mahakaccana (Ðại Ca-chiên-diên) là vị được Thế Tôn tán dương và được các vị đồng phạm hạnh có trí kính trọng.
Tôn giả Mahakaccana có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng dạy này được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt, và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa.
Vậy chúng ta hãy đi đến chỗ Tôn giả Mahakaccana ở, sau khi đến, sẽ hỏi Tôn giả Mahakaccana ý nghĩa này".
17
234
1047
Rồi những Tỷ-kheo ấy đến chỗ Tôn giả Mahakaccana ở, sau khi đến, nói lên những lời chúc tụng, hỏi thăm xã giao với Tôn giả Mahakaccana rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, những Tỷ-kheo ấy thưa với Tôn giả Mahakaccana:
18
203
1250
-- "Này Hiền giả, Thế Tôn sau khi nói lên lời dạy tóm tắt này và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa, từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy và đã đi vào tịnh xá:
"Này Tỷ-kheo, do bất cứ nhân duyên gì...
không còn dư tàn".
19
785
2035
Này Hiền giả Mahakaccana, khi Thế Tôn đi chưa bao lâu, chúng tôi suy nghĩ:
"Chư Hiền, Thế Tôn sau khi nói lên lời dạy vắn tắt này cho chúng ta...
đã đi vào tịnh xá:" Do bất cứ nhân duyên gì...
không còn dư tàn".
Ai có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng dạy mà Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt...
không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa?" Này Hiền giả Mahakaccana, rồi chúng tôi suy nghĩ:
"Nay Tôn giả Mahakaccana được Thế Tôn tán thán và được các vị đồng phạm hạnh có trí kính trọng, Tôn giả Mahakaccana có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng dạy được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa.
Vậy chúng ta hãy đi đến chỗ Tôn giả Mahakaccana ở, sau khi đến, chúng ta hỏi Tôn giả Mahakaccana ý nghĩa này.
Tôn giả Mahakaccana sẽ giải thích cho".
20
722
2757
-- Chư Hiền, cũng như một người ưa thích lõi cây, tìm tòi lõi cây, đi khắp mọi nơi tìm lõi cây, đến một cây to lớn, đứng thẳng và có lõi cây.
Người này bỏ qua rễ, bỏ qua thân cây, nghĩ rằng phải tìm lõi cây ở nơi cành lá.
Cũng vậy là hành động của chư Tôn giả, đứng trước mặt Thế Tôn, quý vị bỏ qua Thế Tôn, nghĩ rằng phải hỏi tôi về ý nghĩa này.
Chư Hiền, Thế Tôn biết những gì cần phải biết, thấy những gì cần phải thấy, Ngài đã trở thành vị có mắt, trở thành vị có trí, trở thành Chánh pháp, trở thành Brahma, vị thuyết giả, vị diễn giả, vị đem lại mục tiêu, vị trao cho bất tử, vị Pháp Chủ, Như Lai.
Quý vị phải tùy thời hỏi Thế Tôn ý nghĩa này.
Những gì Thế Tôn giải thích cho quý vị, quý vị hãy như vậy thọ trì.
21
712
3469
-- Hiền giả Mahakaccana, chắc chắn Thế Tôn biết những gì cần phải biết, thấy những gì cần phải thấy, Ngài đã trở thành vị có mắt, trở thành vị có trí, trở thành Chánh pháp, trở thành Brahma, vị thuyết giả, vị diễn giả, vị đem lại mục tiêu, vị trao cho bất tử, vị Pháp Chủ, Như Lai.
Chúng tôi phải tùy thời hỏi Thế Tôn ý nghĩa này.
Những gì Thế Tôn giải thích cho chúng tôi, chúng tôi sẽ như vậy thọ trì.
Nhưng Tôn giả Mahakaccana được Thế Tôn tán thán, được các vị đồng phạm hạnh có trí kính trọng.
Tôn giả Mahakaccana có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng dạy được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa.
Mong Tôn giả Mahakaccana hãy giải thích không có sự gì bất kính.
22
53
3522
-- Vậy chư Hiền hãy nghe và khéo tác ý, tôi sẽ giảng.
23
23
3545
-- Thưa vâng, Hiền giả.
24
80
3625
Các Tỷ-kheo ấy vâng đáp Tôn giả Mahakaccana.
Tôn giả Mahakaccana giảng như sau:
25
286
3911
-- Chư Hiền, Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt lời dạy này...
và đã đi vào tịnh xá:
"Này Tỷ-kheo bất cứ vì nhân duyên gì...
không còn dư tàn".
Chư Hiền, với lời dạy được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt, và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa.
Tôi hiểu ý nghĩa một cách đầy đủ như sau:
26
378
378
Chư Hiền, do nhơn con mắt và các sắc pháp, nhãn thức khởi lên.
Sự gặp gỡ của ba pháp này là xúc.
Do duyên xúc nên có cảm thọ.
Những gì có cảm thọ thời có tưởng, những gì có tưởng thời có suy tầm, những gì có suy tầm thì có hý luận.
Do hý luận ấy làm nhơn, một số hý luận vọng tưởng ám ảnh một người, đối với các sắc pháp do con mắt nhận thức, quá khứ, tương lai và hiện tại.

Chư Hiền, do nhơn lỗ tai và các tiếng, nhĩ thức khởi lên, do nhơn lỗ mũi và các hương, tỷ thức khởi lên, do nhơn lưỡi và các vị, thiệt thức khởi lên, do nhơn thân và xúc, thân thức khởi lên;
do nhơn ý và các pháp, ý thức khởi lên.
Sự gặp gỡ của ba pháp này là xúc.
Do duyên xúc nên có các cảm thọ.
Những gì có cảm thọ thời có tưởng.
Những gì có tưởng thời có suy tầm.
Những gì có suy tầm thời có hý luận.
Do hý luận ấy làm nhơn, một số hý luận vọng tưởng ám ảnh một người, đối với các pháp do ý thức nhận thức, quá khứ, tương lai và hiện tại.

Chư Hiền, Thế Tôn, sau khi nói lên lời dạy một cách vắn tắt...
đã đi vào tịnh xá:
"Này Tỷ-kheo, do bất cứ nhân duyên gì...
không dư tàn".
Chư Hiền, đối với lời dạy Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt này, và nghĩa lý không được giải thích một cách rộng rãi, tôi đã hiểu ý nghĩa một cách rộng rãi như vậy.
Nếu quý vị muốn, hãy đi đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, sau khi đến, hãy hỏi ý nghĩa này.
Thế Tôn giải đáp như thế nào, hãy như vậy thọ trì.

Rồi những Tỷ-kheo ấy, hoan hỷ, tùy hỷ lời Tôn giả Mahakaccana nói, từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy, đi đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, sau khi đến đảnh lễ Ngài và ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, các Tỷ-kheo ấy bạch Thế Tôn:

1721
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, Thế Tôn nói lên lời dạy này một cách vắn tắt cho chúng con...
đã vào tịnh xá.
"Này Tỷ-kheo, do bất cứ nhân duyên gì...
không còn dư tàn".
Khi Thế Tôn đi chẳng bao lâu, chúng con suy nghĩ như sau:
"Chư Hiền, Thế Tôn sau khi nói cho chúng ta lời dạy tóm tắt này, không giải thích ý nghĩa một cách rộng rãi, từ chỗ ngồi đứng dậy và đã đi vào tịnh xá:
"Này Tỷ-kheo, do bất cứ nhân duyên gì, một số hý luận vọng tưởng ám ảnh một người, nếu ở đây không có gì đáng tùy hỷ, đáng đón mừng, đáng chấp thủ, thời như vậy là sự đoạn tận tham tùy miên, sự đoạn tận sân tùy miên, sự đoạn tận kiến tùy miên, sự đoạn tận nghi tùy miên, sự đoạn tận mạn tùy miên, sự đoạn tận hữu tham tùy miên, sự đoạn tận vô minh tùy miên, sự đoạn tận chấp trượng, chấp kiếm, đấu tranh, tránh tranh, luận tranh, kháng tranh, ly gián ngữ, vọng ngữ.
Chính ở đây, những ác, bất thiện pháp này đều được tiêu diệt, không còn dư tàn".
Nay ai có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng dạy này được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa?" Bạch Thế Tôn, và chúng con suy nghĩ:
"Nay có Tôn giả Mahakaccana là vị được Thế Tôn tán dương và được các vị đồng phạm hạnh có trí kính trọng.
Tôn giả Mahakaccana có thể giải thích rộng rãi ý nghĩa lời giảng dạy này được Thế Tôn nói lên một cách vắn tắt và không giải thích rõ ràng ý nghĩa.
Vậy chúng ta hãy đi đến chỗ Tôn giả Mahakaccana ở, sau khi đến sẽ hỏi Tôn giả Mahakaccana ý nghĩa này".
Bạch Thế Tôn, rồi chúng con đi đến chỗ Tôn giả Mahakaccana ở, sau khi đến, chúng con hỏi Tôn giả Mahakaccana ý nghĩa này.
Bạch Thế Tôn, Tôn giả Mahakaccana đã giải thích ý nghĩa ấy cho chúng con với những phương pháp này, với những văn cú này, với những văn tự này.

-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tôn giả Mahakaccana là bậc Hiền trí.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tôn giả Mahakaccana là bậc Ðại tuệ.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu các Người hỏi Ta ý nghĩa này, Ta cũng trả lời như Mahakaccana đã trả lời.
Như vậy là chính nghĩa lời dạy ấy, hãy như vậy thọ trì.

Khi nghe nói vậy, Tôn giả Ananda bạch Thế Tôn:

2419
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, như một người bị đói lả và mệt mỏi, tìm được một bánh mật, cứ mỗi miếng vị ấy được nếm, cứ mỗi miếng vị ấy được thưởng thức vị ngọt thuần nhất.
Bạch Thế Tôn, cũng vậy, Tỷ-kheo có tri thức biệt tài, cứ mỗi phần suy tư đến ý nghĩa pháp môn này với trí tuệ, cứ mỗi phần vị ấy được thưởng thức sự hoan hỷ, được thưởng thức sự thoải mái tâm trí.
Bạch Thế Tôn, pháp môn này tên gọi là gì?
38

-- Do vậy, này Ananda, pháp môn này được gọi là pháp môn bánh mật (Mật hoàn).
Hãy như vậy thọ trì!

Thế Tôn thuyết giảng như vậy.
Tôn giả Ananda hoan hỷ, tín thọ lời dạy của Thế Tôn.
