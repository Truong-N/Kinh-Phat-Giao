in Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodharama garden.~~ Then, in the morning, the Blessed One put on his robe, took his alms bowl, and went into Kapilavatthu to beg for alms.~ After begging for alms in Kapilavatthu, having eaten, on his way back from begging for alms, the Blessed One went to the Great Forest to rest at noon.~ After entering the Great Forest, he sat down to rest at noon under a beluvalatthika tree.~~ There was a man with a staff (Dandapani) named Sakka, who traveled throughout the world.~ He came to the Great Forest, went deep into the forest, and arrived at Beluvalatthika, where the Buddha was staying.~ Having arrived, he exchanged pleasantries and friendly greetings, then stood to one side, leaning on his staff.~ The man with the staff, Sakka, said to the Buddha:~ "What is the view of the ascetic, and what does he teach?"~~ --"Venerable Sir, according to my teachings, in the world with the gods, Maras, and Brahmas, with the ascetics, Brahmins, gods, and humans, there is no dispute with anyone in the world;~ thoughts will not haunt a Brahmin who lives free from the bondage of desire, without doubt or hesitation, with all remorse eradicated, without craving for existence or non-existence.~ Venerable Sir, this is my view, this is my teaching."~~ Hearing this, Sakka, holding his staff, shook his head, licked his lips, and with three wrinkles appearing on his forehead, leaned on his staff and left.~~ Then, in the afternoon, the Blessed One rose from his solitary meditation and went to the Nigrodha garden.~ Upon arriving, he sat down on the prepared seat.~ After sitting down, the Blessed One called the monks:~~ "Monks, here, this morning, I put on my robe and took my alms bowl to Kapilavatthu to beg for alms.~ After begging for alms in Kapilavatthu and eating, on my way back, I went to the Great Forest to rest at noon.~ After entering the Great Forest, I sat down to rest at noon under a beluvalatthika tree.~ Sakka, holding his staff, wandered everywhere, traveling throughout the land, and came to the Great Forest, going deep into the forest, to Beluvalatthika where I was staying.~ Upon arriving, he exchanged friendly greetings, then stood to one side, leaning on his staff."~ Standing to one side, Sakka, holding his staff, said to me:~ "What is the view of the ascetic, and what does he preach?"~ Having heard this, I replied to Sakka, holding his staff:~ "Venerable sir, according to my teachings, in the world with the gods, Mara, and Brahma, with the ascetics, Brahmins, gods, and humans, there is no dispute with anyone in this world.~ Thoughts will not haunt a Brahmin who lives free from the bondage of desire, without doubt or hesitation, with all remorse eradicated, without craving for existence or non-existence.~ Venerable sir, this is my view, this is my teaching."~ Hearing this, Sakka, holding his staff, shook his head, licked his tongue, and with three wrinkles appearing on his forehead, leaned on his staff and departed.~~ Hearing this, a monk said to the Buddha:~~ "But, Venerable Lord, what is this teaching that, in the world with the gods, Mara and Brahma, with the ascetics, Brahmins, gods and humans, there is no dispute with anyone in the world?~ Will thoughts not haunt the Buddha, who has lived free from the bondage of desire, without doubt or hesitation, with all remorse eradicated, without craving for existence or non-existence?"~~ "Monk, for whatever reason, some frivolous thoughts haunt a person."~ If there is nothing here to rejoice in, to welcome, or to cling to,~ then this is the cessation of latent greed,~ the cessation of latent anger,~ the cessation of latent wrong views,~ the cessation of latent doubt,~ the cessation of latent pride,~ the cessation of latent attachment to existence,~ the cessation of latent ignorance,~ the cessation of clinging to staffs and swords,~ fighting, avoiding conflict, arguing, resisting, divisive speech, and false speech.~ It is here that these evil and unwholesome states are completely eradicated, leaving no trace.~~ Thus the Buddha expounded.~ After saying this, the Well-Gone One rose from his seat and entered the monastery.~~ Shortly after the Buddha departed, those monks thought:~ "Venerable ones, after the Buddha gave us this concise teaching, without elaborately explaining its meaning, he rose from his seat and went into the monastery:~ 'Monks, for whatever reason...~ there is no remainder.'~ Now, who can elaborately explain the meaning of this teaching that the Buddha gave concisely, without explicitly explaining its meaning?"~ Then those monks thought:~ "Now there is Venerable Mahakaccana, whom the Buddha praised and who is respected by his wise fellow practitioners.~ Venerable Mahakaccana can elaborately explain the meaning of this teaching that the Buddha gave concisely, without explicitly explaining its meaning.~ So let us go to where Venerable Mahakaccana is staying, and after arriving, we will ask him about this meaning."~~ Then those monks came to where Venerable Mahakaccana was staying.~ Having arrived, they exchanged greetings and pleasantries with Venerable Mahakaccana, and then sat down to one side.~ Having sat down to one side, those monks said to Venerable Mahakaccana:~~ "Venerable Sir, after the Blessed One had spoken this brief teaching without explaining its meaning clearly, he rose from his seat and went into the monastery:~ 'Bhikkhu, whatever the cause…~ there is no remaining.'"~~ "Venerable Mahakaccana, not long after the Blessed One had gone, we thought:~ 'Venerable Sirs, after the Blessed One had spoken this brief teaching to us… he went into the monastery:~ 'For whatever the cause…~ there is no remaining.'"~ "Who can extensively explain the meaning of the teachings that the Buddha spoke briefly...~ without clearly explaining the meaning?"~ Then, Venerable Mahakaccana, we thought:~ "Now, Venerable Mahakaccana is praised by the Buddha and respected by his wise fellow practitioners.~ Venerable Mahakaccana can extensively explain the meaning of the teachings that the Buddha spoke briefly and without clearly explaining the meaning.~ So let us go to where Venerable Mahakaccana is staying, and after arriving, we will ask Venerable Mahakaccana about this meaning."~ "Venerable Mahakaccana will explain."~~ -- Venerable ones, just as a person who loves the core of a tree searches for it, going everywhere to find it, comes to a large, upright tree with a core.~ This person ignores the roots, ignores the trunk, thinking that the core must be found in the branches and leaves.~ Similarly, Venerable ones, standing before the Buddha, you ignore the Buddha, thinking, "I must ask you about this meaning."~ Venerable ones, the Buddha knows what needs to be known, sees what needs to be seen.~ He has become the one with eyes, the one with wisdom, the one with the Right Dharma, the Brahma, the speaker, the orator, the one who brings about the goal, the one who bestows immortality, the Lord of the Dharma, the Tathagata.~ You must ask the Buddha about this meaning at any time.~ Whatever the Buddha explains to you, you should accept it accordingly.~~ -- Venerable Mahakaccana, surely the Buddha knows what needs to be known, sees what needs to be seen.~ He has become the one with eyes, To become a wise one, to become the Dharma, to become Brahma, the preacher, the speaker, the one who brings about the goal, the one who bestows immortality, the Dharma Master, the Tathagata.~ We must ask the Blessed One about this meaning from time to time.~ Whatever the Blessed One explains to us, we will accept as such.~ But Venerable Mahakaccana is praised by the Blessed One and respected by his wise fellow practitioners.~ Venerable Mahakaccana can extensively explain the meaning of the teachings that the Blessed One has spoken briefly and without explicitly explaining the meaning.~ May Venerable Mahakaccana explain without any disrespect.~~ -- Then, Venerable Ones, listen and pay close attention, I will explain.~~ -- Yes, Venerable One.~~ Those monks replied to Venerable Mahakaccana.~ Venerable Mahakaccana explained as follows:~~ -- Venerable Ones, the Blessed One spoke this teaching briefly...~ and entered the monastery:~ "O monks, for whatever reason...~ not "Remaining remnants."~ Venerable Ones, with the teachings spoken briefly by the Buddha, without clearly explaining their meaning,~ I understand the full meaning as follows:~~ Venerable Ones, due to the eye and visual phenomena, visual consciousness arises.~ The encounter of these three is contact.~ Due to contact, there is feeling.~ What has feeling gives rise to perception;;what has perception gives rise to deliberation;;what has deliberation gives rise to speculation.~ Due to this speculation, some deluded speculations haunt a person regarding the visual phenomena perceived by the eye—past, future, and present.~~ Venerable Ones, due to the ear and sounds, auditory consciousness arises;~ due to the nose and scents, olfactory consciousness arises;~ due to the tongue and tastes, gustatory consciousness arises;~ due to the body and contact, tactile consciousness arises;~ due to the mind and phenomena, mental consciousness arises.~ The encounter of these three is contact.~ Due to contact, there are feelings.~ What has feeling Feeling arises from perception.~ What arises from perception gives rise to contemplation.~ What arises from contemplation gives rise to speculation.~ Because of this speculation, a number of delusional speculations haunt a person regarding phenomena perceived by consciousness—past, future, and present.~~ Venerable ones, this is what happens:~ whenever there is sight, whenever there is form, whenever there is visual consciousness, the manifestation of contact is revealed.~ This is what happens:~ whenever there is the manifestation of contact, the manifestation of feeling is revealed.~ This is what happens:~ whenever there is the manifestation of feeling, the manifestation of perception is revealed.~ This is what happens:~ whenever there is the manifestation of perception, the manifestation of speculation is revealed.~ This is what happens:~ whenever there is the manifestation of speculation, the manifestation of the haunting of a number of delusional speculations is revealed.~~ This event occurs:~ when there is an ear, when there are sounds, when there is auditory consciousness...~ This event occurs:~ when there is a nostril, when there are smells, when there is olfactory consciousness...~ This event occurs:when there is a tongue, when there are tastes, when there is gustatory consciousness...~ This event occurs:~ when there is a body, when there are touches, when there is bodily consciousness...~ This event occurs:~ when there is a mind, when there are phenomena, when there is mental consciousness, then the manifestation of contact is revealed.~~ Venerable ones, this event does not occur:~ when there is no eye, when there are no forms, when there is no visual consciousness, the manifestation of contact is revealed.~ This event does not occur:~ when there is no manifestation of contact, the manifestation of feeling is revealed.~ This event does not occur:~ when there is no manifestation of feeling, the manifestation of perception is revealed.~ This event does not occur:~ when there is no construction of thought, the construction of reflection is revealed.~ This event does not occur:~ when there is no construction of reflection, the construction of obsession with some illusory thoughts is revealed.~~ Venerable ones, this event does not occur:~ when there is no ear, when there are no sounds...~ when there is no nose, when there are no smells...~ when there is no tongue, when there are no tastes...~ when there is no body, when there are no touches...~ This event does not occur:~ when there is no mind, when there are no phenomena, when there is no consciousness, the construction of touch is revealed...~~ Venerable ones, the Blessed One, after speaking a brief teaching...~ entered the monastery:~ "Bhikkhu, for whatever cause...~ there is no remainder."~ Venerable ones, regarding this brief teaching of the Buddha, whose meaning is not extensively explained, I have understood its meaning in this broad sense.~ If you wish, go to where the Buddha is staying, and upon arriving, ask about its meaning.~ Whatever the Buddha answers, accept it accordingly.~~ Then those monks, rejoicing in the words of the Venerable Mahakaccana, rose from their seats and went to where the Buddha was staying.~ Upon arriving, they paid homage to Him and sat down to one side.~ After sitting down to one side, those monks addressed the Buddha:~~ --Venerable Lord, the Buddha has briefly taught us this teaching...~ upon entering the monastery.~ "Monks, for whatever reason...~ there is no remaining residue."~ Shortly after the Buddha departed, we reflected:~ "Venerable ones, after the Buddha briefly expounded this teaching to us without elaborately explaining its meaning, he rose from his seat and entered the monastery, saying:~ 'O monks, whatever the cause, if a person is afflicted by various delusive thoughts and delusions,~ and there is nothing here worthy of rejoicing, welcoming, or clinging to,~ then this is the cessation of latent craving, the cessation of latent anger, the cessation of latent views, the cessation of latent doubt, the cessation of latent pride, the cessation of latent attachment to existence, the cessation of latent ignorance, the cessation of clinging to staffs and swords,~ fighting, quarreling, arguing, resisting, divisive speech, and false speech.~ It is here that these evil and unwholesome states are completely eradicated, leaving no trace.'~ Now, who can elaborate on the meaning of this teaching that the Buddha briefly expounded without elaborate explanation?"~ "Venerable Lord, we thought:~ 'Now there is Venerable Mahakaccana, whom the Lord praises and who is respected by his fellow practitioners of wisdom.~ Venerable Mahakaccana can extensively explain the meaning of this teaching which the Lord has spoken briefly and without clearly explaining its meaning.~ So let us go to where Venerable Mahakaccana is staying, and after arriving, we will ask him about this meaning.'~ Venerable Lord, we went to where Venerable Mahakaccana was staying, and after arriving, we asked him about this meaning.~ Venerable Lord, Venerable Mahakaccana explained that meaning to us using these methods, these phrases, these texts.~~ -- Bhikkhus, Venerable Mahakaccana is a wise one.~ Bhikkhus, Venerable Mahakaccana is a great one."~ "Bhikkhus, if you ask me the meaning of this, I will answer as Mahakaccana answered.~ This is the true meaning of that teaching;;therefore, uphold it accordingly."~~ Hearing this, Venerable Ananda said to the Buddha:~~ "Venerable Lord, just as a person who is starving and weary finds a honey cake, with each bite he tastes, with each bite he savors the purest sweetness, so too,~ Venerable Lord, a monk with exceptional knowledge, with each part he contemplates the meaning of this teaching with wisdom, with each part he savors joy, he savors mental comfort.~ Venerable Lord, what is the name of this teaching?"~~ "Therefore, Ananda, this teaching is called the honey cake teaching (Honey Cake Teaching).~ Uphold it accordingly!"~~ Thus the Buddha expounded.~ Venerable Ananda rejoiced and accepted the Buddha's teaching with faith.~~ `
