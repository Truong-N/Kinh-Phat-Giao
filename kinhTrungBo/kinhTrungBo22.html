Upon arriving, they paid homage to the Buddha and sat down to one side.~ After sitting down to one side, the monks addressed the Buddha:~~ --Venerable Lord, the monk Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, held the following evil view:~ "In my understanding, the Dharma the Buddha teaches...~ has no obstacles."~ Venerable Lord, we heard:~ "The monk named Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer...~ has no obstacles."~ Venerable Lord, then we went to where the monk Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, arrived and immediately said to the monk Arittha:~ --"Venerable Arittha, is it true that..." Is that true?~ Venerable raised the following evil and wrong view:~ "As far as I understand...~ there really is no obstacle."~~ "Venerable Lord, upon hearing this, the monk Arittha, who used to train falcons, said to us:~ --"That is indeed true.~ Venerable ones, as far as I understand...~ there really is no obstacle."~~ "Venerable Lord, we wish to make the monk Arittha, who formerly worked as a falcon trainer, abandon that evil and erroneous view. So we questioned him, challenged him with the reason, and discussed:~ "--"Venerable Arittha, do not speak like that!~ Do not slander the Buddha.~ Slandering the Buddha is not good.~ The Buddha did not say that, Venerable Arittha. The Buddha has used many methods to teach that hinder the path to enlightenment.~ And those who use them are inherently hindered.~ The Buddha has taught that desires bring little joy, much suffering, and much distress, thus making them even more dangerous.~ The Buddha has taught that desires are likened to a bone...~ The Buddha has taught that desires are likened to a snake's head, bringing little joy, much suffering, and much distress, thus making them even more dangerous."~~ "Venerable Lord, the monk Arittha, formerly a falcon trainer, despite our questioning, challenging, and discussion, still stubbornly holds onto that evil and erroneous view:~ "Indeed, as I understand it, the Dharma taught by the Venerable Lord...~ has no obstacles."~ Venerable Lord, since we could not make the monk Arittha, formerly a falcon trainer, abandon that evil and erroneous view, we have come to ask the Venerable Lord for his meaning.~~ Then the Venerable Lord summoned another monk:~~ "Monk, go and in my name call the monk Arittha, formerly a falcon trainer, saying:~ "Venerable Arittha, the Master calls you."~~ "Yes, Venerable Lord."~~ That monk, obeying the Buddha, went to the monk Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer. Upon arriving, he said to Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer:~~ -- Venerable Arittha, the Master calls you Venerable.~~ -- Yes, Venerable.~~ Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, replied to that monk and went to where the Buddha was. Upon arriving, he paid homage to the Buddha and sat down to one side.~ The Buddha said to Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer and was sitting to one side:~~ -- Arittha, is it true that you have the following evil view:~ "As I understand it...~ there really is no obstacle"?~~ -- It is true, Venerable Lord.~ As far as I understand, there is truly no obstacle.~~ -- O foolish one, how do you understand the Dharma I teach in this way?~ O foolish one, have I not used many methods to teach that hinder the path to enlightenment?~ And those who use them will inevitably be hindered?~ I have taught that desires bring little joy, much suffering, much distress, and therefore are all the more dangerous.~ I have taught that desires are likened to a bone...~ I have taught that desires are likened to a piece of meat...~ likened to a bundle of dry grass...~ likened to a burning pit of coals...~ likened to a dream...~ likened to borrowed utensils...~ likened to fruit...~ likened to a slaughterhouse...~ likened to a sharp stick...~ I have taught that desires are likened to a snake's head, bringing little joy, much suffering, much distress, and therefore are all the more dangerous.~ And you, you fool, not only have you distorted me, but you have also committed a wrong, self-destructive act, and created much harm.~ And you, you fool, this will bring you lasting misfortune and suffering.~~ Then the Blessed One addressed the monks:~~ -- Monks, what do you think?~ Can the monk Arittha, who used to train falcons, possibly spark any light in this Dharma and Vinaya?~~ -- Blessed One, how could that be!~ It is impossible, Blessed One.~~ Having been told this, the monk Arittha, who used to train falcons, fell silent, ashamed, slumped his shoulders, bowed his head, became anxious, and kept his mouth shut.~ Then the Blessed One, having learned that the monk Arittha, formerly a falcon trainer, was silent, ashamed, slumped, bowed his head, anxious, and speechless, said to the monk Arittha:~~ -- You fool, you will be known by your own evil and wrong views.~ Here, I will ask the monks.~~ Then the Blessed One called the monks:~~ -- Monks, do you understand the Dharma that I teach, just as this monk Arittha, formerly a falcon trainer, has not only distorted me by clinging to false doctrines, but has also destroyed himself and caused much harm?~~ -- No, Blessed One.~ Blessed One, you have used many methods to obstruct the path of the Dharma;~ and those who use them are themselves hindered.~ The Buddha taught that desires bring little joy, much suffering, and much distress, and therefore are all the more dangerous. The Buddha taught that desires are like a bone...~ (as above)...~ The Buddha taught that desires are like a snake's head, bringing little joy, much suffering, much distress, and therefore are all the more dangerous.~~ -- Excellent, monks!~ Excellent, monks!~ You understand the Dharma I have taught thus.~ Monks, I have used many methods to teach that there are obstacles to the path of Dharma, and those who use them are inherently afflicted.~ I taught that desires bring little joy, much suffering, and much distress, and therefore are all the more dangerous.~ I taught that desires are like a bone...~ (as above)...~ I taught that desires are like a snake's head, bringing little joy, much suffering, much distress, and therefore are all the more dangerous.~ But the monk Arittha, who formerly trained falcons, not only distorted me by clinging to erroneous views, but also destroyed himself and created much harm, thus leading to long-lasting misfortune and suffering for that foolish person.~~ Indeed, monks, this does not happen; one can enjoy desires beyond desires, beyond imagined desires, beyond sought desires.~~ (The example of the snake)~~ Monks, there are some foolish people here who study the Dharma, such as the Sutras, the Suttas, the Explanations, the Verses, the Inspiring Sayings, the Such Sayings, the Jataka Stories, the Unprecedented Teachings, and the Extensive Teachings.~ After studying these teachings, they do not contemplate the meaning of these teachings with wisdom.~ Because the meaning of these teachings is not contemplated with wisdom, they do not become clear.~ They study the Dharma only for personal gain, wanting to criticize others, only for personal gain, wanting to enjoy arguing, and they do not achieve the goal that the study of the Dharma aims for.~ Because they hold onto the Dharma incorrectly, they lead to unhappiness and prolonged suffering.~ Why is that?~ O monks, because they hold onto the Dharma incorrectly.~~ Bhikkhus, it is like a person who desires a water snake, seeks a water snake, and goes everywhere looking for one.~ He sees a large water snake, and he catches it by its back or tail.~ The snake may turn and bite him on his hand, arm, or some other part of his body, and he may die or suffer near-death pain because of this.~ Why is this?~ Bhikkhus, because he grasps the snake incorrectly.~ Similarly, bhikkhus, here, some foolish people study the Dharma...~ Bhikkhus, because of their incorrect clinging to the Dharma.~~ Here, bhikkhus, some virtuous men study the Dharma, such as the Sutras, the Suttas, the Explanations, the Verses, the Inspirational Sayings, the Such Sayings, the Jataka Tales, the Unprecedented Dharma, the Extensive Teachings.~ After studying these teachings, they contemplate their meaning with wisdom.~ Because their meaning is contemplated by wisdom, these teachings become clear.~ They study the teachings not for personal gain, not to criticize others, not for personal gain, not to enjoy arguing, and they achieve the goal that studying the teachings aims for.~ Because they skillfully grasp these teachings, they lead them to lasting happiness and peace.~ Why is that?~ Bhikkhus, because they skillfully grasp the teachings.~~ Bhikkhus, it is like a person who desires a water snake, searching everywhere for one.~ That person finds a large water snake.~ That person can skillfully subdue the water snake with a stick.~ After skillfully subduing it with a stick, that person can skillfully grasp the snake's neck.~ Bhikkhus, even if that water snake were to coil its body around one's hand, or arm, or any other part of the body, that person would not, because of that cause, come to death or to suffering near death.~ Why is that?~ Bhikkhus, because one skillfully holds the water snake.~~ Similarly, Bhikkhus, here, some virtuous men learn the Dharma...~ Bhikkhus, because one skillfully holds the Dharma.~ Therefore, Bhikkhus, understand the meaning of my teachings and uphold them accordingly.~ If anyone does not understand the meaning of my teachings, they should ask me here or ask wise Bhikkhus.~~ (The example of the raft)~~ Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dharma as a raft to cross over, not to cling to.~ Listen carefully and pay close attention, I will teach.~~ -- Yes, Venerable Lord.~~ Those monks replied to the Venerable Lord.~ The Venerable Lord then taught as follows:~~ -- O monks, imagine a person walking on a long road, coming to a wide body of water. One bank is dangerous and terrifying, the other is safe and not frightening, but there is no boat to cross or no bridge to connect the two banks.~ That person thinks to himself:~ "This is a wide body of water, one bank is dangerous and terrifying, the other is safe and not frightening, but there is no boat to cross or no bridge to connect the two banks.~ Now I will gather grass, trees, branches, and leaves, tie them together to make a raft, and relying on this raft, diligently using my hands and feet, I can safely cross to the other bank."~ Bhikkhus, then that person gathered grass, branches, and leaves, tied them together to make a raft, and with this raft, diligently used his hands and feet to safely cross to the other shore.~ Having crossed to the other shore, that person thought:~ "This raft is very useful to me; thanks to this raft, I diligently used my hands and feet to safely cross to the other shore.~ Now I should carry this raft on my head or on my shoulder and go wherever I want."~ Bhikkhus, what do you think?~ Bhikkhus, if that person does that, is he using the raft for its intended purpose?~~ -- No, Venerable Lord.~~ -- Bhikkhus, how should that person use the raft for its intended purpose?~ Here, monks, after crossing to the other shore, that person might think:~ "This raft has been very helpful to me.~ Thanks to this raft, I have diligently used my hands and feet to safely cross to the other shore.~ Now I will pull this raft onto dry land, or sink it into the water, and go wherever I want."~ Monks, by doing so, that person is using the raft correctly.~ Similarly, monks, I teach the Dharma like a raft to cross over, not to cling to.~~ Bhikkhus, you should understand the analogy of the raft.~ Even the Dharma must be abandoned, how much more so the Dharma itself.~~ (The Views)~~ "Now, monks, there are six kinds of views.~ What are these six?"~ Here, monks, there is an uneducated, ordinary person who does not go to see the Noble Ones, does not become proficient in the teachings of the Noble Ones, does not practice the teachings of the Noble Ones, does not go to see the True Ones, does not become proficient in the teachings of the True Ones, does not practice the teachings of the True Ones, and when he sees material things, he says:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self," when he sees feelings, he says:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self," when he sees perceptions, he says:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self," when he sees mental formations, he says:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self," when he sees what is seen, heard, felt, perceived, attained, sought, or thought about, he says:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self," and in every sense he says... that:~ "This is the world, this is the self; after death, I will remain, eternal, permanent, unchanging; I will dwell like this forever," thus it is seen as:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self."~~ And, O monks, there is a learned noble disciple who goes to see nobles, is skilled in noble teachings, practices noble teachings, goes to see virtuous people, is skilled in virtuous teachings, practices virtuous teachings, and observes material things:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self," observes feelings:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self," observes perception:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self," observes mental formations:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self," observes what is seen, heard, felt, perceived, attained, sought, or contemplated:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self" "My self," and any view that says:~ "This is the world, this is the self, after death I will remain, permanent, abiding, unchanging, I will dwell like this forever," thus seeing it as:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self."~ By observing in this way, this person has no anxiety or distress regarding things that do not truly exist.~~ (Anxiety)~~ Having heard this, another monk said to the Buddha:~~ -- Is there anything that does not truly exist outside, that can cause anxiety and distress?~~ The Buddha replied:~~ -- It is possible, O monks, that there is a person here who thinks as follows:~ "What was certainly mine, is now certainly no longer mine.~ What could certainly be mine, I will certainly not obtain."~ That person grieves, laments, weeps, beats his chest, and faints.~ O monks, thus, there is something external that is unreal, which can cause anxiety and distress.~~ -- Venerable Lord, is there anything external that is unreal, which can not cause anxiety and distress?~~ The Buddha replied:~~ -- It is possible, O monks, that there is a person here, O monks, who does not think as follows:~ "What was certainly mine, is now certainly no longer mine.~ What could certainly be mine, I will certainly not obtain."~ That person does not grieve, lament, weep, beat their chest, or faint.~ Thus, O Bhikkhu, there is something unreal outside that does not cause anxiety or distress.~~ -- Venerable Lord, is there anything unreal within that can cause anxiety or distress?~~ The Venerable Lord replied:~~ -- Yes, O Bhikkhu, there is a person here, O Bhikkhu, who has the following (wrong) view:~ "This is the world, this is the self, after death, I will be permanent, eternal, abiding without change.~ I will remain like this forever."~ This person hears the Tathagata or the Tathagata's disciples preaching the Dharma to eradicate all views, clinging, bias, prejudice, latent tendencies, to cease all actions, to abandon all causes of rebirth, to eradicate craving leading to detachment, cessation, and Nirvana.~ That person might think:~ "Surely I will be annihilated, surely I will perish, surely I will cease to exist."~ That person grieves, laments, weeps, beats their chest, and faints.~ "Bhikkhu, this is what is unreal within that can cause anxiety and distress."~~ -- "Venerable Lord, is there anything unreal within that does not cause anxiety and distress?"~~ The Venerable Lord replied:~~ -- It is possible, monks, that there is a person here who does not have the following (wrong) view:~ "This is the world, this is the self, after death, I will be permanent, eternal, abiding, unchanging, I will remain like this forever."~ This person listens to the Tathagata or his disciples preaching the Dharma to eradicate all views, attachments, biases, prejudices, latent tendencies, the purification of all actions, the renunciation of all causes of rebirth, the eradication of craving, leading to detachment, cessation, and Nirvana.~ He does not think as follows:~ "Surely I will be annihilated, surely I will perish, surely I will cease to exist."~ He does not grieve, lament, or weep;~ he does not beat his chest, nor does he faint.~ Monks, this is the non-existent within, which does not cause anxiety or distress.~~ (Impermanence and Non-Self)~~ "Bhikkhus, can you hold onto any possession, and will that possession remain permanent, everlasting, unchanging, and endure forever?"~ "Bhikkhus, can you see any possession that is held onto, and will that possession remain permanent, everlasting, unchanging, and endure forever?"~~ -- "No, Lord."~~ -- "Excellent, Bhikkhus."~ "Bhikkhus, I also do not see any possession that is held onto, and will that possession remain permanent, everlasting, unchanging, and endure forever."~ "Now, monks, is there any clinging to the doctrine of self that, when clung to in this way, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, distress, and anguish?"~ "Now, monks, have you seen any clinging to the doctrine of self that, when clung to in this way, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, distress, and anguish?"~~ -- "No, Lord."~~ -- "Excellent, monks."~ "Now, monks, I also do not see any clinging to the doctrine of self that, when clung to in this way, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, distress, and anguish."~ "Now, monks, is there any reliance on view that, when relied upon in this way, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, distress, and anguish?"~ "Now, monks, is there any reliance on view that, when clung to in this way, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, distress, and anguish?" "Now, monks, have you seen any view that, when based on such a foundation, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, anxiety, or distress?"~~ -- "No, Lord."~~ -- "Excellent, monks!"~ "Monks, I also have not seen any view that, when based on such a foundation, does not give rise to sorrow, grief, suffering, anxiety, or distress."~ "Monks, if there is a self, is there a self belonging to me?"~~ -- "Yes, Lord."~~ -- "Monks, if there is a self belonging to me, is there a self belonging to me?"~~ -- "Yes, Lord."~~ -- Bhikkhus, if the self and its possessions cannot be accepted as permanent, everlasting, then this view:~ "This is the world, this is the self, after death I will become permanent, everlasting, abiding, unchanging, I will abide like this forever."~ Bhikkhus, is that view completely, thoroughly, and without ignorance?~~ -- How can it be completely, thoroughly, and without ignorance?~~ -- Bhikkhus, what do you think?~ Is form permanent or impermanent?~~ -- Bhikkhu, it is impermanent.~~ -- Is that which is impermanent suffering or pleasure?~~ -- Bhikkhu, it is suffering.~~ -- Is it reasonable to contemplate something that is impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay as:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self"?~~ -- No, Lord.~~ -- Are feelings permanent or impermanent?~~ -- Yes, Lord.~~ -- Is something that is impermanent suffering or pleasure?~~ -- Yes, Lord.~~ -- Is it reasonable to contemplate something that is impermanent, suffering, and subject to decay as:~ "This is mine...~ my self"?~~ -- No, Lord.~~ -- Are perceptions permanent or impermanent?~~ -- No, Lord. ~~ -- What is impermanent...?~~ -- No, Venerable Lord.~~ -- Monks, are conditioned phenomena permanent or impermanent...?~ Monks, is consciousness permanent or impermanent?~~ -- Impermanent, Venerable Lord.~~ -- Is what is impermanent suffering or pleasure?~~ -- Suffering, Venerable Lord.~~ - Is it reasonable to consider what is impermanent and suffering when one contemplates it as:~ "This is mine, this is me, this is my self"?~~ -- No, Venerable Lord.~~ -- Therefore, monks, whatever material phenomena may be, past, future, present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near;~ All material phenomena are:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self," one must truly contemplate with right wisdom.~ Any feeling...~ Any perception...~ Any volition...~ Any consciousness, past, future, present, internal or external, coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness is:~ "This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self," one must truly contemplate with right wisdom.~~ Bhikkhus, seeing this, the learned noble disciple becomes detachment from form, detachment from feeling, detachment from perception, detachment from volitional formations, detachment from consciousness; through detachment, he becomes free from craving; through freedom from craving, he attains liberation; in liberation, wisdom arises, and he knows that he is liberated.~ He knows:~ "Birth has ceased, the holy life has been accomplished, what needed to be done has been done, there is no return here to another life."~~ (An Arhat)~~ Bhikkhus, that monk is called one who has cast off the obstacles, one who has filled the trenches, one who has uprooted the pillar, one who has unlocked the locks, one who has lowered the banner, who has laid down the burden, and is free from attachment.~~ And what is it when a monk has cast off the obstacles?~ Here, monks, is when ignorance is eradicated, cut off at its roots, like a palm tree that has been beheaded, so that it cannot be reborn in the future, it has no possibility of arising.~ Monks, thus is it when a monk has cast off the obstacles.~~ What is it when a monk has filled the trenches?~ Here, monks, a monk has eradicated rebirth and the cycle of birth and death, cut off at its roots, like a palm tree that has been beheaded, so that it cannot be reborn in the future, it has no possibility of arising.~ Monks, thus is it when a monk has filled the trenches.~~ What is it when a monk has uprooted the pillar?~ Here, monks, a monk has eradicated craving, cut it down at its roots, like a palm tree that has been beheaded, so that it cannot be reborn in the future, it has no possibility of arising.~ Monks, thus a monk has uprooted the pillar.~~ Monks, what is it when a monk has unlocked the locks?~ Here, monks, a monk has eradicated the five lower fetters, cut them down at their roots, like a palm tree that has been beheaded, so that it cannot be reborn in the future, it has no possibility of arising.~ Monks, thus a monk has unlocked the locks.~~ Monks, what is it when a noble monk has lowered the banner, laid down the burden, and is free from attachment?~ Here, monks, a monk has eradicated pride, cut it down at its roots, like a palm tree that has been beheaded, so that it cannot be reborn in the future, it has no possibility of arising.~ Monks, thus a noble monk has lowered his banner, laid down his burden, and is free from attachment.~~ Monks, a monk who has thus attained liberation, the gods in the Indra realm, the Brahma realm, and the realm of the Lord of Birth will not find any trace of that monk if they think:~ "Here, the consciousness of the Tathagata resides."~ Why is that?~ "Bhikkhus, I say that in the present moment, a Tathagata cannot be found without a trace."~~ (Distortion of the Tathagata)~~ "Bhikkhus, I say this, I teach this, but some ascetics and Brahmins distort me in a false, confused, illusory, and unreal way:~ "The ascetic Gotama advocates nihilism, extols annihilation, destruction, and the annihilation of sentient beings."~ But, bhikkhus, I am not like that, I do not say that, I am not like those ascetics and Brahmins who have distorted me in a false, confused, illusory, and unreal way:~ "The ascetic Gotama advocates nihilism, extols annihilation, destruction, and the annihilation of sentient beings."~~ "Bhikkhus, then as now, I only speak of suffering and the cessation of suffering."~ "Bhikkhus, if there were others here..." If others insult, slander, or anger the Tathagata, then, O monks, the Tathagata is not angry, not displeased, and his mind is not resentful.~ If others show respect, reverence, worship, and offerings to the Tathagata, then, O monks, the Tathagata is not joyful, not delighted, and his mind is not pleased.~ If others show respect, reverence, worship, and offerings to the Tathagata, then, O monks, the Tathagata thinks:~ "This is something I have known for a long time:~ This is my responsibility to do."~~ Therefore, O monks, if others insult, slander, or anger you, do not be angry, dissatisfied, or resentful.~ Therefore, O monks, if others show respect, reverence, worship, and offerings. Therefore, O monks, do not rejoice, be delighted, or feel pleasure in this place.~ Therefore, O monks, if others show you respect, reverence, and make offerings to you, then reflect here:~ "This is something I have known for a long time; these are my responsibilities."~~ (No Possession)~~ Therefore, monks, whatever is not yours, abandon it.~ By abandoning it, you will attain lasting happiness and peace.~ Monks, what is not yours?~ Monks, form is not yours; abandon form.~ By abandoning form, you will attain lasting happiness and peace.~ Monks, feeling is not yours; abandon feeling.~ By abandoning feeling, you will attain lasting happiness and peace.~ Monks, perception is not yours; abandon perception.~ By abandoning perception, you will attain lasting happiness and peace.~ Monks, mental formations are not yours; abandon mental formations.~ You should abandon the actions that will bring you lasting happiness and peace.~ Bhikkhus, consciousness is not yours; abandon consciousness.~ You should abandon consciousness; it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.~~ Bhikkhus, what do you think?~ In this Jetavana forest, if someone were to gather grass, trees, branches, and leaves and burn or do with them as they please, would you think?~ Would that person gather us, burn us, or do with us as they please?~~ -- No, Lord.~ Why?~ Because, Lord, it is not self or the possession of the self.~~ -- Likewise, Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, you should abandon.~ Your renunciation will bring you lasting happiness and peace.~ Monks, what is not yours?~ Monks, form is not yours; renounce form.~ Your renunciation of form will bring you lasting happiness and peace.~ Monks, feeling...~ (as above)...~ Monks, perception...~ (as above)...~ Monks, volition...~ Monks, consciousness is not yours; renounce consciousness.~ Your renunciation of consciousness will bring you lasting happiness and peace.~~ (The Dharma is well expounded)~~ Monks, thus, the Dharma I have skillfully expounded, made clear, enlightened, and revealed, has removed the old coverings.~ Bhikkhus, because the Dharma I have skillfully expounded, revealed, enlightened, and revealed, removing the old coverings, those Bhikkhus who are Arhats, whose defilements have been eradicated, whose practice is complete, whose tasks have been accomplished, whose burdens have been laid down, whose ideals have been achieved, whose fetters have been severed, who are liberated through right knowledge, cannot be described in the cycle of birth and death.~~ Bhikkhus, thus, the Dharma I have skillfully expounded...~ removes the old coverings.~ Bhikkhus, because the Dharma I have skillfully expounded, removing the old coverings, those Bhikkhus who have severed the five lower fetters, these Bhikkhus become beings born here, entering Nirvana here, and will not return to this world again.~~ Bhikkhus, thus, the Dharma which I have skillfully taught...~ is freed from the old fetters.~ Bhikkhus, because the Dharma which I have skillfully taught...~ is freed from the old fetters, those bhikkhus who have eradicated the three fetters, who have diminished greed, hatred, and delusion, all of them become Stream-Enterers, and in this lifetime once more will eradicate all suffering.~~ Bhikkhus, thus, the Dharma which I have skillfully taught...~ is freed from the old fetters.~ Bhikkhus, because the Dharma which I have skillfully taught...~ is freed from the old fetters, those bhikkhus who have eradicated the three fetters, all of them become Stream-Enterers, no longer subject to the evil realms, and are determined to attain enlightenment.~~ Bhikkhus, thus, the Dharma which I have skillfully taught...~ is freed from the old fetters.~ Bhikkhus, because the Dharma I have skillfully expounded...~ has removed the old coverings, therefore, those bhikkhus who practice according to the Dharma and according to faith, all of them will be directed toward enlightenment.~~ Bhikkhus, thus the Dharma I have skillfully expounded...~ has removed the old coverings.~ Bhikkhus, because the Dharma I have skillfully expounded, revealed, enlightened, and made clear, has removed the old coverings, therefore, those who have sufficient faith in me and sufficient love for me, all of them will be directed toward the gods.~~ Thus the Blessed One expounded.~ Those bhikkhus rejoiced and accepted the Blessed One's teaching.~ `

không xảy ra, người ta có thể thọ dụng các dục ngoài các dục, ngoài các dục tưởng, ngoài các dục tầm.~~ (Ví dụ con rắn)~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây có một số người ngu si học pháp, như Kinh, Ứng tụng, Giải thuyết, Kệ tụng, Cảm hứng ngữ, Như thị ngữ, Bổn sanh, Vị tằng hữu pháp, Phương quảng.~ Sau khi học các pháp này, họ không quán sát ý nghĩa những pháp ấy với trí tuệ.~ Những pháp ấy, vì ý nghĩa không được trí tuệ quán sát, nên không trở thành rõ ràng.~ Họ học các pháp chỉ vì lợi ích, muốn chỉ trích người khác, chỉ vì lợi ích, muốn khoái khẩu biện luận, và họ không đạt được mục tiêu mà sự học pháp hướng đến.~ Những pháp ấy vì nắm giữ sai lạc nên đưa họ đến bất hạnh, đau khổ lâu dài.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Này các Tỷ-kheo, vì nắm giữ sai lạc các pháp.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người ưa muốn rắn nước, tìm cầu rắn nước, đi khắp chỗ để tìm rắn nước.~ Người đó thấy một con rắn nước lớn, và người đó bắt con rắn ấy ở lưng hay ở đuôi.~ Con rắn ấy có thể quay lại cắn người đó nơi tay, nơi cánh tay hay ở một phần nào khác của cơ thể, và người đó có thể do nhân này mà bị chết hay bị đau khổ gần như chết.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì nắm bắt con rắn một cách sai lạc.~ Cũng vậy này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, một số người ngu si học pháp...~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì sự chấp thủ các pháp sai lạc.~~ Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, một số Thiện nam tử học pháp, như Kinh, Ứng tụng, Giải thuyết, Kệ tụng, Cảm hứng ngữ, Như thị ngữ,

pháp không vì lợi ích, muốn chỉ trích người khác, không vì lợi ích, muốn khoái khẩu biện luận, và họ đạt được mục tiêu mà sự học pháp hướng đến.~ Những pháp ấy, vì khéo nắm giữ, nên đưa họ đến hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Này các Tỷ-kheo, vì khéo nắm giữ các pháp.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người ưa muốn rắn nước, tìm cầu rắn nước đi khắp chỗ để tìm rắn nước.~ Người đó thấy một con rắn nước lớn.~ Người đó có thể khéo đè con rắn nước với cây gậy có nạng.~ Sau khi khéo đè với cây gậy có nạng, người đó có thể khéo nắm giữ cổ rắn.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, dầu cho con rắn nước ấy có thể cuốn thân nó xung quanh tay, hay cánh tay, hay một thân phần nào khác, người đó cũng không vì nhân duyên ấy đi đến chỗ chết hay đến sự đau khổ gần như chết.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì khéo nắm giữ con rắn nước vậy.~~ Cũng vậy, chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, một số Thiện nam tử học pháp...~ chư Tỷ-kheo, vì khéo nắm giữ các pháp vậy.~ Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, hãy hiểu rõ ý nghĩa lời Ta thuyết giảng và thọ trì

các Tỷ-kheo, ví như có người đang đi trên con đường lớn dài, đến một vùng nước rộng, bờ bên này nguy hiểm và hãi hùng, bờ bên kia an ổn và không kinh hãi, nhưng không có thuyền để vượt qua hay không có cầu bắc qua từ bờ này đến bờ kia.~ Người đó tự suy nghĩ:~ "Ðây là vùng nước rộng, bờ bên này nguy hiểm và hãi hùng, bờ bên kia an ổn và không kinh hãi, nhưng không có thuyền để vượt qua hay không có cầu bắc qua từ bờ này đến bờ kia.~ Nay ta hãy thâu góp cỏ, cây, nhánh, lá, cột lại thành chiếc bè, và dựa trên chiếc bè này, tinh tấn dùng tay chân, có thể vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, rồi người đó thâu góp cỏ, cây, nhánh, lá cột lại thành chiếc bè, và nhờ chiếc bè này, tinh tấn dùng tay chân vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn.~ Khi qua bờ bên kia rồi, Người đó suy nghĩ:~ "Chiếc bè này lợi ích nhiều cho ta, nhờ chiếc bè này, ta tinh tấn dùng tay chân để vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn.~ Nay ta hãy đội chiếc bè này trên đầu hay vác nó trên vai, và đi đến chỗ nào ta muốn".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu người đó làm như vậy, thì có làm đúng với sở dụng của chiếc bè chăng?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.~~ -- Chư Tỷ-kheo, người đó phải làm thế nào cho đúng sở dụng của chiếc bè?~ Ở đây, chư Tỷ-kheo, người đó sau khi vượt qua bờ bên kia, có thể suy nghĩ:~ "Chiếc bè này lợi ích nhiều cho ta.~ Nhờ chiếc bè này, ta tinh tấn dùng tay chân đã vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn.~ Nay ta hãy kéo chiếc bè này lên trên bờ đất khô, hay nhận chìm xuống nước, và đi đến chỗ nào ta muốn".~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, làm như vậy, người đó làm đúng sở dụng chiếc bè ấy.~ Cũng vậy, này chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta thuyết pháp như chiếc bè để vượt qua, không phải để nắm giữ lấy.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần hiểu ví dụ cái bè.~ Chánh pháp còn phải bỏ đi, huống nữa là phi pháp.~~ (Các kiến xứ)~~ Này các Tỷ-kheo, có sáu kiến xứ.~ Thế nào là sáu?~ Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, có kẻ vô văn phàm phu, không đi đến yết kiến các bậc Thánh, không thuần thục pháp các bậc Thánh,

dấu vết".~~ (Xuyên tạc Như Lai)~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta nói như vậy, thuyết như vậy, một số Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn xuyên tạc Ta một cách phi chơn, hồ đồ, hư vọng, không thực:~ "Sa-môn Gotama chủ trương chủ nghĩa hư vô, đề cao đoạn diệt, hủy diệt, sự tiêu diệt các hữu tình".~ Nhưng này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta không là như vậy, Ta không nói như vậy, Ta không như các Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn ấy đã xuyên tạc một cách phi chơn,

đây, những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái, cúng dường Như Lai, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây Như Lai không có hoan hỷ, sung sướng, Tâm không thích thú.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái, cúng dường Như Lai, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây Như Lai suy nghĩ:~ "Ðây là điều xưa kia đã từng biết rõ:~ ở đây là trách nhiệm Ta phải làm".~~ Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu có những người khác nhiếc mắng, phỉ báng, làm cho các Ông tức giận, ở đây các Ông chớ có sân hận, bất mãn, tâm chớ khởi phẫn nộ.~ Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu có những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái cúng dường các Ông, thì ở đây, các Ông chớ có hoan hỷ, sung sướng, tâm sanh thích thú.~ Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu có những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái cúng dường các Ông, thì ở đây, các Ông hãy suy nghĩ:~ "Ðây là điều xưa kia đã từng biết rõ, đây là những trách nhiệm ta phải làm".~~ (Không sở hữu)~~ Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, cái gì không phải của các Ông, các Ông hãy từ bỏ.~ Các Ông từ bỏ, sẽ đưa lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, cái gì không phải của các Ông?~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, sắc không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ sắc.~ Các Ông từ bỏ sắc sẽ đưa lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, thọ không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ thọ.~ Các Ông từ bỏ thọ sẽ đưa lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, tưởng không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ tưởng.~ Các Ông từ bỏ tưởng sẽ đem lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các hành không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ các hành.~ Các Ông từ bỏ các hành sẽ đem lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, thức không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ thức.~ Các Ông từ bỏ thức sẽ đem lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?~ Trong rừng Jetavana này, nếu có người thâu lượm cỏ, cây, nhành, lá rồi đốt hay làm với chúng tùy theo ý muốn, các Ông có nghĩ chăng?~ Người ấy thâu lượm chúng ta, đốt chúng ta hay làm với chúng ta tùy theo ý muốn?~~ -- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.~ Vì sao vậy?~ Bạch Thế Tôn, vì nó không phải tự ngã hay không phải sở thuộc của ngã.~~ -- Cũng vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, cái gì không phải của các Ông, các Ông hãy từ bỏ.~ Các Ông từ bỏ sẽ đưa lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, và cái gì không phải của các Ông?~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, sắc không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ sắc.~ Các Ông từ bỏ sắc sẽ đưa lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, thọ...~ (như trên)...~ Chư Tỷ-kheo tưởng...~ (như trên)...~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, hành...~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, thức không phải của các Ông, hãy từ bỏ thức.~ Các Ông từ bỏ thức sẽ đem lại hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài cho các Ông.~~ (Pháp khéo giảng)~~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy, pháp được Ta khéo giảng, làm cho tỏ lộ, làm cho khai thông, làm cho khai thị, được loại trừ các vải quấn cũ.~ Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì pháp được Ta khéo giảng, làm tỏ lộ, làm cho khai thông, làm cho khai thị, được loại trừ các vải quấn cũ, nên những vị Tỷ-kheo, là bậc A-la-hán, các lậu hoặc đã tận, tu hành thành mãn, việc nên làm đã làm, gánh nặng đã đặt xuống, lý tưởng đã thành đạt, hữu kiết sử đã đoạn trừ, được giải thoát nhờ chánh trí, vòng luân chuyển (sanh tử) của những vị này
