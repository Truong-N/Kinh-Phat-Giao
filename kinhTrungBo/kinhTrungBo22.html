22. Sutra Example of a snake

(Alagaddupama sutta)

Thus I heard.

188
At one time the World-Honored One was at Savatthi, at Jetavana, in the garden of Anathapindika (Anathapindika).
6
241
429
At that time, a monk named Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, had the following evil view:
"According to my understanding of the Dharma preached by the World-Honored One, when taking advantage of the dharmas that the World-Honored One calls obstacle dharmas, there really are no obstacles."
7
431
860
A large number of monks heard the following:
"A monk named Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, had the following evil views:
"According to my understanding of the Dharma preached by the World-Honored One, when taking advantage of the dharmas that the World-Honored One calls obstacle dharmas, there really are no obstacles."
Then those Bhikkhus went to the place of Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer. When they arrived, they immediately said to Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, as follows:
8
142
1002
-- Venerable Arittha, is it true that you have the following evil views:
"As I understand...
There really are no obstacles"?
9
76
1078
-- That's true, Venerable Ones.
As far as I understand...
there are no obstacles.
10
1085
2163
Then those Bhikkhus wanted Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, to give up that evil view. They immediately questioned him, questioned the reason, and discussed:
--"Sage Arittha, don't say that, don't misrepresent the World-Honored One.
Misrepresenting the World-Honored One is not good.
The World-Honored One did not say so.
Sage Arittha, the World-Honored One used many methods to explain the dharma of obstacles.
And those who use them are self-sufficient and encounter obstacles.
The World-Honored One taught that pleasures are few, sufferings are many, worries are many, and therefore dangers are greater.
The World-Honored One said that desires are like bones...
The World-Honored One said that desires are likened to a piece of meat...
The World-Honored One said that all desires are like a torch of dry grass...
The World-Honored One said that desires are likened to a pit of burning coals...
The World-Honored One said that all desires are like a dream...
The World-Honored One said that desires are like borrowed objects...
The World-Honored One said that desires are like fruits...
The World-Honored One said that desires are likened to a slaughterhouse...
The World-Honored One has said that desires are likened to sharp sticks...
The World-Honored One has said that desires are likened to a snake's head, with less joy, more suffering, more anxiety, and therefore more danger.
11
264
2427
Bhikkhu Arittha, who was a falcon trainer in the past, even though he was questioned and discussed by those Bhikkhus, still spoke up about that evil and wrong view, was stubborn, held tightly to that wrong view:
"Indeed, as I understand it, the teachings of the World-Honored One...
There are no obstacles."
12
243
2670
Because the Bhikkhus could not make Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, give up that evil view, they went to the place where the Blessed One lived. When they arrived, they bowed to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.
After sitting down to one side, those monks said to the World-Honored One:
13
601
3271
-- World-Honored One, Bhikkhu Arittha, who once worked as a falcon trainer, had the following evil views:
"As I understand it, the Dharma preached by the World-Honored One...
There are no obstacles".
World-Honored One, we hear:
"A monk named Arittha, used to be a falcon trainer...
There are no obstacles".
World-Honored One, we then went to the place of Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer. When we arrived, we immediately said to Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer:
--"Hey Venerable Arittha, is it true?
The sage arose from evil views as follows:
"As I understand...
There are really no obstacles."
14
196
3467
World-Honored One, when he heard that, Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, told us as follows:
--"That's true.
Dear Sirs, as I understand...
There are really no obstacles."
15
655
4122
World-Honored One, we want to make the Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, give up that evil view. We immediately questioned him, questioned the reason, and discussed:
--"Sage Arittha, don't say that!
Do not misrepresent the World-Honored One.
Misrepresenting the World-Honored One is not good.
The World-Honored One did not say so. Sage Arittha, the World-Honored One used many methods to explain the dharma of obstacles.
And those who take advantage of them are self-sufficient and encounter obstacles.
The World-Honored One taught that pleasures are few, sufferings are many, worries are many, and therefore dangers are greater.
The World-Honored One said that desires are like bones...
The World-Honored One has said that desires are likened to a snake's head, with little joy, much suffering, much anxiety, and therefore even more danger.
16
437
437
World-Honored One, Bhikkhu Arittha, who once worked as a falcon trainer, even though we questioned him, questioned him about the reason, and discussed him, still spoke up about that evil and wrong view, stubbornly, firmly grasping and holding tightly to that wrong view:
"Indeed, as I understand it, the Dharma preached by the World-Honored One...
There are no obstacles".
World-Honored One, because we cannot make the Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, give up that evil view, so we come to ask the World-Honored One the meaning of this.
17
37
474
Then the World-Honored One called another monk:
18
144
618
-- Bhikkhu, go and call in my name Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer:
"Sage Arittha, the Teacher calls you Sage".
19
27
645
-- Yes, Venerable One.
20
164
809
That monk obeyed the Blessed One and went to the place of Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer. After arriving, he immediately said to Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer:
21
45
854
-- Sage Arittha, the Teacher calls you Sage.
22
23
877
-- Yes, Sage.
23
238
1115
Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, responded to the Bhikkhu, went to where the Blessed One lived, and after arriving, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.
The World-Honored One said to the Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, who was sitting to one side:
24
121
1236
-- Arittha, is it true that you have the following evil view:
"As I understand...
There really are no obstacles"?
25
85
1321
-- That's true, World-Honored One.
As far as I understand, there are really no obstacles.
26
895
2216
-- Hey foolish person, why do you understand the Dharma I preach like that?
Hey foolish person, is it possible that I have used many dharma methods to explain the dharma of obstacles?
And those who use them are self-sufficient and encounter obstacles?
I have taught that pleasures are less, suffering is more, and suffering is more, so there are more dangers.
I have said that desires are likened to bones...
I have said that desires are likened to a piece of meat...
compared to a torch of dry grass...
compared to a burning coal pit...
like a dream...
considered as a loan item...
compared to fruit...
is likened to a meat furnace...
compared to a sharp stick...
I have said that desires are likened to a snake's head, with little joy, much suffering, much worry, and therefore even more danger.
And you foolish person, not only have you misrepresented me, but you have wrongly attached yourself, you have sabotaged yourself and caused much harm.
This, foolish man, will bring you long-term unhappiness and suffering.
27
28
2244
Then the World-Honored One called the monks:
28
154
2398
-- Monks, what do you think?
Bhikkhu Arittha, who once worked as a falcon trainer, could any spark of light be sparked in this Dharma and Vinaya?
29
68
2466
-- World-Honored One, how is this possible!
It is impossible, Venerable One.
30
324
2790
Being told that, Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to work as a falcon trainer, remained silent, ashamed, slumped his shoulders, bowed his head, worried, and shut his mouth.
Then the World-Honored One, after learning that Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to work as a falcon trainer, was silent, ashamed, slumped his shoulders, bowed his head, worried, and kept his mouth shut, he said to Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer:
31
108
2898
-- Foolish man, people will know you through your own evil views.
Here, I will ask the monks.
32
28
2926
Then the World-Honored One called the monks:
33
223
3149
-- Bhikkhus, do you understand the Dharma I preach, like Bhikkhu Arittha, who once worked as a falcon trainer, not only misrepresented me because of his wrong attachment, but also sabotaged himself and caused much loss of virtue?
34
404
3553
-- World-Honored One, no.
World-Honored One, the World-Honored One used many methods to explain the dharma of obstacles;
and those who take advantage of them are self-sufficient in being hindered.
The World-Honored One taught that sensual pleasures are less, suffering is more, and suffering is more, so there are more dangers. The World-Honored One said that sensual pleasures are like bones...
(as above)...
The World-Honored One said that desires are like a snake's head, with little joy, much suffering, much anxiety, and therefore even more danger.
35
685
685
-- How good, monks!
How good, monks!
You understand the Dharma I preach like this.
Monks, I have used many dharma methods to explain the dharma of obstacles, and those who use them will be hindered by themselves.
I have taught that sensual pleasures are less, suffering is more, suffering is more, and therefore there are more dangers.
I have said that desires are like bones...
(as above)...
I have said that desires are like the head of a snake, with little joy, much suffering, much worry, and therefore even more danger.
But Bhikkhu Arittha, who used to be a falcon trainer, not only misrepresented me because of his false self-attachment, but also sabotaged himself and created a lot of damage, and this would lead to unhappiness and long-term suffering for that foolish person.
36
139
824
Actually, monks, this event does not happen, people can enjoy sensual pleasures outside of sensual pleasures, outside of sensual thoughts, outside of sensual thoughts.
37
15
839
(Snake example)
38
622
1461
Monks, here there are some foolish people who study the Dharma, such as Sutras, Responses, Explanations, Verses, Inspiration, Such as Speech, Original Birth, Dharma-Buddhist Monks, and Directions.
After learning these dharmas, they do not contemplate the meaning of those dharmas with wisdom.
Those dharmas, because their meaning is not observed by wisdom, do not become clear.
They study the dharma just for the sake of it, want to criticize others, just for the sake of it, want to enjoy arguing, and they do not achieve the goal that studying the dharma aims at.
Those dharmas, because they are held wrongly, lead them to unhappiness and long-term suffering.
Why is that?
Monks, because of wrong grasping of the dharmas.
39
524
1985
Monks, it is like a person who desires water snakes, searches for water snakes, and goes everywhere to find water snakes.
He sees a large water snake, and he catches the snake by its back or by its tail.
That snake may turn around and bite that person in the hand, arm or some other part of the body, and that person may die or suffer almost to the point of death because of this.
Why is that?
Monks, because of grasping the snake in a wrong way.
Likewise, monks, here, some foolish people study the Dharma...
Monks, because of your attachment to wrong dharmas.
40
596
2581
Here, monks, some good men study the Dharma, such as Sutras, Responses, Explanations, Verses, Inspirational Speech, As-Thought Speech, Original Birth, Dharma-Buddhist Sangha, and Direction.
After studying these dharmas, they observe the meaning of those dharmas with wisdom.
Those dharmas, because their meaning is observed by wisdom, become clear.
They study the Dharma not for profit, not for the sake of criticizing others, not for benefit, for the pleasure of arguing, and they achieve the goal that studying the Dharma aims at.
These dharmas, because they are mastered well, should bring them to lasting happiness and peace.
Why is that?
Monks, because of skillful grasp of the Dharma.
41
527
3108
Monks, it is like a person who desires water snakes, searches for water snakes and goes everywhere to find water snakes.
That person saw a large water snake.
That person can skillfully weigh down the water snake with a stick and crutch.
After skillfully applying pressure with a stick and crutch, that person can skillfully hold the snake's neck.
Monks, even if that water snake were able to wrap its body around a hand, or an arm, or some other part of the body, that person would not, because of that cause, go to death or to a suffering almost like death.
Why is that?
Monks, because you skillfully hold the water snake.
42
314
3422
Likewise, monks, here, some good men study the Dharma...
Bhikkhus, because you grasp the dharmas so skillfully.
Therefore, monks, please clearly understand the meaning of what I preach and accept it like this.
If anyone does not clearly understand the meaning of what I preach, then here, you should ask me or ask the intellectual monks.
43
16
3438
(Example: raft)
44
136
3574
Monks, I will teach you the Dharma, like a raft to cross, not to hold.
Listen and pay careful attention, I will preach.
45
27
3601
-- Yes, Venerable One.
46
65
3666
Those monks answered yes to the World-Honored One.
The Buddha preached as follows:
47
1140
1140
-- Monks, suppose someone is traveling on a long road, arriving at a wide body of water, this shore is dangerous and terrifying, the other shore is safe and fearless, but there is no boat to cross or no bridge to cross from one shore to the other.
That person thinks to himself:
"This is a wide body of water, this shore is dangerous and terrifying, the other shore is safe and fearless, but there are no boats to cross or bridges to cross from one shore to the other.
Now let us gather grass, trees, branches, leaves, tie them together into a raft, and relying on this raft, diligently using our hands and feet, we can safely cross to the other side."
Monks, then that person gathered grass, trees, branches, and leaves and tied them into a raft, and thanks to this raft, he diligently used his hands and feet to safely cross to the other side.
When he crossed to the other side, that person thought:
"This raft benefits me a lot. Thanks to this raft, I diligently use my hands and feet to safely cross to the other side.
Now let us carry this raft on our heads or carry it on our shoulders, and go wherever we want."
Monks, what do you think?
Monks, if that person did so, would he do it according to the purpose of the raft?
48
23
1163
-- World-Honored One, no.
49
537
1700
-- Bhikkhus, what should a person do to properly use the raft?
Here, monks, that person, after crossing over to the other shore, can think:
"This raft is of great benefit to me.
Thanks to this raft, I diligently used my hands and feet to safely cross to the other side.
Now let us pull this raft up onto dry land, or sink it into the water, and go wherever we want."
Monks, by doing so, one is making the right use of that raft.
Likewise, monks, I preach the Dharma as a raft to cross over, not to hold onto.
50
94
1794
Monks, you need to understand the example of a raft.
Dharma must still be abandoned, let alone illegal.
51
13
1807
(The Land of Views)
52
1078
2885
Monks, there are six bases of view.
What is six?
Here, monks, there is an uneducated ordinary person who does not go to see the Saints, does not master the dharma of the Saints, does not practice the dharma of the Saints, does not go to see the Saints, does not master the dharma of the Saints, does not practice the dharma of the Saints, looking at the physical dharma:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self", see feeling:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my ego", see thought:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self", see the formations:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self", see what is seen, heard, felt, conscious, achieved, sought after, thought about:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self", and any view base says:
"This is the world, this is the self, after death I will be permanent, permanent, permanent, unchangeable, I will abide like this forever", seen thus as:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self."
53
1240
4125
And, monks, there is a well-learned Noble Disciple who goes to see the Noble Ones, is well-versed in the Dharma of the Noble Ones, practices the Dharma of the Noble Ones, goes to meet the Noble Ones, is well-versed in the Dharma of the Noble Ones, practices the Dharma of the Noble Ones, and looks at the physical dharma:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", see feeling:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", see thought:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", see the formations:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", see what is seen, what is heard, what is felt, what is conscious, what is achieved, what is sought after, what is thought about:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", and any view base says:
"This is the world, this is the self, after death I will be permanent, permanent, permanent, unchangeable, I will abide like this forever", seeing it thus:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self."
Due to such contemplation, this person does not have anxiety or depression regarding things that do not really exist.
54
7
4132
(Anxiety)
55
49
4181
Hearing this, another monk said to the World-Honored One:
56
71
71
-- Could there be something out there that doesn't really exist, that could cause anxiety and sadness?
57
12
83
The World-Honored One replied:
58
347
430
-- It is possible, monk, here, someone thinks like this:
"What was definitely mine, is definitely no longer mine.
What can definitely be mine, I definitely can't get it."
That person was sad, lamented, cried, beat his chest, and lost consciousness.
Monks, like this, there is something that does not really exist outside, which can cause anxiety and depression.
59
91
521
-- World-Honored One, is it possible that there is something out there that does not really exist, that does not cause anxiety or sadness?
60
12
533
The World-Honored One replied:
61
382
915
-- It is possible, monk, here, monk, there are people who do not think like this:
"What was definitely mine, is definitely no longer mine.
What can definitely be mine, I definitely can't get it."
That person does not grieve, complain, cry, beat his chest, or lose consciousness.
Thus, monk, there is something that does not really exist outside, which does not cause anxiety or sorrow.
62
87
1002
-- World-Honored One, could there be something not really there that could cause anxiety and sadness?
63
12
1014
The World-Honored One replied:
64
737
1751
-- There may be, monk, here, monk, there is a person who has the following (wrong) view:
"This is the world, this is the self, after death I will be permanent, permanent, permanent and unchangeable.
I will stay like this forever."
This person listens to the Tathagata or the Tathagata's disciples preaching the Dharma to eliminate all base views, stubbornness, partial attachments, prejudices, and addictions, the cessation of all actions, the abandonment of all attachments, the eradication of craving leading to separation from greed, cessation, Nirvana.
That person might think like this:
"Surely I will be destroyed, surely I will be destroyed, surely I will cease to exist."
That person was sad, lamented, cried, beat his chest, and lost consciousness.
Monks, this means that there is something that is not real inside that can cause anxiety and depression.
65
88
1839
-- World-Honored One, can there be something that is not really there, that does not cause anxiety and depression?
66
12
1851
The World-Honored One replied:
67
756
2607
-- It is possible, monk, here, there are people who do not have (wrong) views as follows:
"This is the world, this is the self, after death I will remain, permanent, permanent, unchangeable, I will abide like this forever."
This person listens to the Tathagata or the Tathagata's disciples preaching the Dharma to eliminate all base views, stubbornness, partiality, preconceptions, and addictions, the purification of all actions, the abandonment of all attachments, the eradication of craving and craving to lead to separation from greed, cessation, Nirvana.
He does not think like this:
"Surely I will be destroyed, surely I will be destroyed, surely I will cease to exist."
He does not grieve, complain, or cry;
He does not beat his chest, nor does he lose consciousness.
Monks, in this way there is something that is not real inside, which does not cause anxiety or depression.

(Impermanent and selfless)

Monks, can you hold on to any possession, and that possession that is held will be permanent, permanent, permanent, unchangeable, can it stay like this forever?
Monks, can you see a possession that is held and that the possession that is held will be permanent, permanent, permanent, unchangeable, can stay like this forever?
70
23
3029
-- World-Honored One, no.
71
509
3538
-- How good, monks.
Monks, I also do not see any held possession, but that held possession will be permanent, permanent, permanent, unchangeable, able to stay like this forever.
Monks, can you cling to any ego-argument that, when grasped like that, does not give rise to sadness, lamentation, pain, sadness, and grief?
Monks, have you seen any ego-argument that, when grasped like that, does not give rise to sadness, lamentation, pain, sadness, and grief?
72
22
3560
-- Buddha no.
73
414
3974
-- How good, monks.
Monks, I also do not see any ego-argument that, when grasped like that, does not give rise to sadness, lamentation, pain, sadness, and grief.
Monks, do you have any kind of robe that, given such advice, does not give rise to sadness, lamentation, pain, worry, or anxiety?
Monks, have you seen any robe that, with such robe advice, does not give rise to sadness, lamentation, pain, worry, or anxiety?
74
22
3996
-- World-Honored One, no
75
219
219
-- How good, monks!
Monks, I have not seen a single robe that, with such robes, does not give rise to sadness, lamentation, pain, sadness, or grief.
Monks, if there is a self, is there a self that belongs to me?
76
20
239
-- World-Honored One, yes.
77
63
302
-- Monks, if there is a self, is there a self?
78
20
322
-- World-Honored One, yes.
79
338
660
-- Monks, if the self and the belonging to the self cannot be accepted as permanent, permanent, then see this place:
"This is the world, this is the self, after death I will become permanent, permanent, permanent, unchanging, I will remain like this forever."
Monks, is the view of that land complete and thorough and not foolish?
80
70
730
-- World-Honored One, how can one be completely and utterly ignorant!
81
71
801
-- Hey monks, what do you think?
Is form permanent or impermanent?
82
27
828
-- Lord Buddha, impermanence.
83
35
863
-- What is impermanent, is it suffering or pleasure?
84
21
884
-- World-Honored One, suffering.
85
156
1040
-- If something is impermanent, suffering, subject to change, is it reasonable to contemplate it as:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self"?
86
23
1063
-- World-Honored One, no.
87
48
1111
-- Monks, is feeling permanent or impermanent?
88
30
1141
-- World-Honored One, it is impermanent.

-- What is impermanent...?
96

Monks, is consciousness permanent or impermanent?

-- Lord Buddha, impermanence.
99

- Is something impermanent and suffering reasonable? When you contemplate it properly, it is:
"This is mine, this is me, this is my self"?
102
23
1810
-- World-Honored One, no.
103
608
2418
-- Therefore, monks, whatever physical phenomena, past, future, present, internal or external, gross or subtle, weak or superior, far or near;
All physical phenomena are:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", needs to be contemplated as it really is with right wisdom.
Any feeling...
Any idea...
Any action...
Whatever consciousness, past, future, present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousnesses are:
"This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self", needs to be contemplated as it really is with right wisdom.

Bhikkhus, thanks to seeing this, the learned Noble Disciple has renounced form, renounced feelings, renounced thoughts, renounced mental formations, renounced consciousness, because of renunciation he is freed from greed, because of renunciation, he is liberated. In liberation, wisdom arises, knowing that he is liberated.
He knows:
"Birth has ended, the holy life has been achieved, what should be done has been done, there is no more returning here to another life."

Monks, that monk is called the one who has thrown away the obstacles, the one who has filled the trenches, the one who has uprooted the pillars, the one who has opened up the locks, the Saint who has put down the flag, who has laid down the burden, without any consequences.
107
285
3347
And how is it that a monk has thrown away obstacles?
Here, monks, ignorance has been eliminated, the root cut off, making it like a ta-la tree with its head cut off, making it impossible to be reborn in the future, incapable of arising.
Monks, in this way the Monks have thrown away all obstacles.
108
322
3669
Monks, how is it that a monk has filled the trenches?
Here, monks, the monk has eliminated rebirth and the cycle of birth and death, has cut off the roots, made it like a ta-la tree with its head cut off, making it impossible to be reborn in the future, incapable of arising.
Monks, thus the monks have filled the trench.
109
287
3956
Monks, how is it that a monk has uprooted himself from the pillar?
Here, monks, the monk has eliminated craving, cut off the root, made it like a ta-la tree with its head cut off, making it impossible to be reborn in the future, incapable of arising.
Bhikkhus, thus the Bhikkhu has uprooted himself from the pillar.
110
307
307
Hey monks, how is it that a monk has opened the locked edges?
Here, monks, the monk has eliminated the five lower fetters, has cut off the root, making it like a ta-la tree with its head cut off, making it impossible to be reborn in the future, incapable of arising.
Monks, thus the monks have opened the locked edges.
111

707
Monks, what is a noble monk who has put down the flag, laid down the burden, and has no consequences?
Here, monks, the monk has eliminated pride, cut off the root, made it like a ta-la tree with its head cut off, making it impossible to be reborn in the future, incapable of arising.
Bhikkhus, such a Bhikkhu of the Holy level has taken down the flag, laid down the burden, there is no consequence.
112
293
1000
Bhikkhus, if a Bhikkhu has been liberated like that, then the Devas in the Thich Thien Realm, the Brahma World, and the Master Realm will not be able to find traces of that Bhikkhu, if they think:
"He is here, has the Tathagata's consciousness."
Why is that?
Monks, I say right now, a Tathagata cannot be traced.
113
19
1019
(Distorting Tathagata)
114
494
1513
Monks, I say like that, talk like that, some Samanas and Brahmins misrepresent Me in a way that is not true, misleading, false, and unreal:
"The monk Gotama advocates nihilism, promoting annihilation, annihilation, the annihilation of sentient beings."
But, monks, I am not like that, I do not say that, I am not like those Samanas and Brahmins who distort it in an untrue, confused, false, and untrue way:
"The monk Gotama advocates nihilism, promoting annihilation, annihilation, the annihilation of sentient beings."
115
631
2144
Monks, in the past and in the present, I only speak of suffering and the cessation of suffering.
Monks, if here others scold, slander, and make the Tathagata angry, then, monks, here, the Tathagata has no anger, no dissatisfaction, and no indignation in his mind.
Monks, if here, other people respect, respect, worship, and make offerings to the Tathagata, then, monks, here the Tathagata has no joy or happiness, and the mind is not interested.
Monks, if others revere, respect, worship, and make offerings to the Tathagata, then, monks, here the Tathagata thinks:
"This is something that was known clearly in the past:
Here is the responsibility I have to do."
116
533
2677
Therefore, monks, if there are others who scold, slander, and make you angry, here you should not be angry or dissatisfied, and your mind should not become indignant.
Therefore, monks, if there are others who respect, respect, worship and make offerings to you, then here, you should not be happy, happy, or interested in your mind.
Therefore, monks, if there are others who revere, respect, worship and make offerings to you, then here, you should think:
"This is something we once knew clearly, these are the responsibilities we have to do."
117

2691
(Do not own)
118

Therefore, monks, what is not yours, you should give up.
If you give up, it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, what is not yours?
Monks, form is not yours, give up form.
If you give up your physical appearance, it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, feeling is not yours, give up feeling.
If you give up life, it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, perception is not yours, give up perception.
You give up thinking that it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, the actions are not yours, give up the actions.
If you give up your actions, it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, consciousness is not yours, give up consciousness.
If you give up consciousness, it will bring lasting happiness and peace to you.
119
249
3779
Monks, what do you think?
In this Jetavana forest, if someone gathered grass, trees, branches, leaves and then burned them or did with them as they wished, would you think?
Does he collect us, burn us, or do with us as he wishes?
120
108
3887
-- World-Honored One, no.
Why is that?
Buddha, because it is not the self or not a property of the self.
121
542
542
-- Likewise, monks, you should give up whatever is not yours.
If you give up, it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, and what is not yours?
Monks, form is not yours, give up form.
If you give up your physical appearance, it will bring you lasting happiness and peace.
Monks, life...
(as above)...
Monks, think...
(as above)...

Bhikkhus, in this way, the Dharma is skillfully taught by me, made clear, made clear, made clear, and the old wrappings are eliminated.
Bhikkhus, because the Dharma has been skillfully taught by me, revealed, opened up, revealed, and old swaddling clothes have been eliminated, those Bhikkhus, who are Arhats, have had their defilements eliminated, have completed their practice, have done what should be done, have laid down their burdens, their ideals have been achieved, the fetters of existence have been eliminated, and are liberated through right wisdom, the cycle of birth and death of these people cannot be explained.
124
307
1384
Monks, thus, the Dharma well taught by me...
old wraps are excluded.
Bhikkhus, because the Dharma is skillfully taught by me, the old swaddling clothes are eliminated, so those Bhikkhus who have eliminated the five lower fetters will become those who are reincarnated and pass away here, and will no longer have to return to this life.
125
328
1712
Monks, thus, the Dharma well taught by me...
old wraps are excluded.
Monks, because of the Dharma skillfully taught by me...
Having been able to get rid of the old wrappings, those Bhikkhus who have eliminated the three fetters and have reduced greed, anger and ignorance, all of them will become Once-returners, only in this life they will once again end suffering.
126
306
2018
Monks, thus, the Dharma well taught by me...
old wraps are excluded.
Monks, because of the Dharma skillfully taught by me...
Having been able to get rid of the old wrappings, those Bhikkhus who have eliminated the three fetters will all become Stream-winners, no longer falling into the evil realms, and determined to attain enlightenment.
127
267
2285
Monks, thus, the Dharma well taught by me...
old wraps are excluded.
Monks, because the Dharma is well taught by me...
The old swaddling clothes are eliminated, so those monks who practice according to the Dharma and practice with faith, all of them will aim for enlightenment.
128
334
2619
Monks, then the Dharma is skillfully taught by me...
are excluded from the old wraps.
Bhikkhus, because the Dharma is skillfully taught by Me, made clear, made clear, made clear, and eliminated old wrappings, those who only have enough faith in Me, only enough love for Me, all of them will be directed to the Gods.
129

The World-Honored One preached like that.
Those monks were happy and believed in the Buddha's teachings.

Một thời Thế Tôn ở Savatthi (Xá-vệ), tại Jetavana (Kỳ-đà Lâm), vườn ông Anathapindika (Cấp Cô Ðộc).
6
241
429
Lúc bấy giờ, Tỷ-kheo tên là Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, khởi lên ác tà kiến như sau:
"Theo như ta hiểu pháp Thế Tôn thuyết giảng, khi thọ dụng những pháp được Thế Tôn gọi là chướng ngại pháp, thật sự không có chướng ngại gì".
7
431
860
Một số đông Tỷ-kheo nghe như sau:
"Tỷ-kheo tên Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, khởi lên ác tà kiến như sau:
"Theo như ta hiểu pháp Thế Tôn thuyết giảng, khi thọ dụng những pháp được Thế Tôn gọi là chướng ngại pháp, thật sự không có chướng ngại gì".
Rồi những Tỷ-kheo ấy đi đến chỗ Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, khi đến xong, liền nói với Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng như sau:
8
142
1002
-- Này Hiền giả Arittha, có đúng sự thật rằng, Hiền giả khởi lên ác tà kiến như sau:
"Theo như tôi hiểu...
thật sự không có chướng ngại gì"?
9
76
1078
-- Thật sự là vậy, chư Hiền.
Theo như tôi hiểu...
không có chướng ngại gì.
10
1085
2163
Rồi những Tỷ-kheo ấy muốn Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng từ bỏ ác tà kiến ấy, liền cật vấn, nạn vấn lý do, thảo luận:
--"Hiền giả Arittha, chớ nói như vậy, chớ xuyên tạc Thế Tôn.
Xuyên tạc Thế Tôn là không tốt.
Thế Tôn không có nói như vậy.
Hiền giả Arittha, Thế Tôn đã dùng nhiều pháp môn thuyết chướng đạo pháp.
Và những ai thọ dụng chúng tự đủ bị chướng ngại.
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như khúc xương...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như một miếng thịt...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như bó đuốc cỏ khô...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như hố than hừng...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như cơn mộng...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như vật dụng cho mượn...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như trái cây...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục vọng được ví như lò thịt...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục vọng được ví như gậy nhọn...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như đầu rắn, vui ít khổ nhiều, não nhiều và do vậy, nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn".
11
264
2427
Tỷ-kheo Arittha xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, dầu được các Tỷ-kheo ấy cật vấn, chất vấn thảo luận, vẫn nói lên ác tà kiến ấy, cứng đầu, chấp chặt, nắm chặt tà kiến ấy:
"Thật sự là vậy, theo như tôi hiểu, pháp Thế Tôn thuyết giảng...
không có chướng ngại gì".
12
243
2670
Vì các Tỷ-kheo không thể làm cho Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, từ bỏ ác tà kiến ấy, nên họ đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, khi đến xong, đảnh lễ Thế Tôn và ngồi xuống một bên.
Sau khi ngồi xuống một bên, những Tỷ-kheo ấy bạch Thế Tôn:
13
601
3271
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, khởi lên ác tà kiến như sau:
"Theo tôi hiểu, pháp Thế Tôn thuyết giảng...
không có chướng ngại gì".
Bạch Thế Tôn, chúng con nghe:
"Tỷ-kheo tên Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng...
không có chướng ngại gì".
Bạch Thế Tôn, rồi chúng con đi đến chỗ Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, khi đến xong, liền nói với Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng:
--"Này Hiền giả Arittha, có đúng sự thật chăng?
Hiền giả khởi lên ác tà kiến như sau:
"Theo như tôi hiểu...
thật sự không có chướng ngại gì".
14
196
3467
Bạch Thế Tôn, khi nghe nói vậy, Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, nói với chúng con như sau:
--"Thật sự là vậy.
Chư Hiền, theo như tôi hiểu...
thật sự không có chướng ngại gì".
15
655
4122
Bạch Thế Tôn, chúng con muốn khiến Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, từ bỏ ác tà kiến ấy, liền cật vấn, nạn vấn lý do, thảo luận:
--"Hiền giả Arittha, chớ nói như vậy!
Chớ xuyên tạc Thế Tôn.
Xuyên tạc Thế Tôn là không tốt.
Thế Tôn không có nói như vậy, Hiền giả Arittha, Thế Tôn đã dùng nhiều pháp môn thuyết chướng đạo pháp.
Và những ai thọ dụng chúng, tự đủ bị chướng ngại.
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như khúc xương...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục được ví như đầu rắn, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, và do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn".
16
437
437
Bạch Thế Tôn, Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, dầu được chúng con cật vấn, nạn vấn lý do, thảo luận, vẫn nói lên ác tà kiến ấy, cứng đầu, chấp chặt, nắm chặt tà kiến ấy:
"Thật sự là vậy, theo tôi hiểu, pháp Thế Tôn thuyết giảng...
không có chướng ngại gì".
Bạch Thế Tôn, vì chúng con không thể làm cho Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, từ bỏ ác tà kiến ấy, nên chúng con đến hỏi Thế Tôn ý nghĩa này.
17
37
474
Rồi Thế Tôn cho gọi một Tỷ-kheo khác:
18
144
618
-- Này Tỷ-kheo, hãy đi và nhân danh Ta gọi Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng rằng:
"Hiền giả Arittha, bậc Ðạo Sư gọi Hiền giả".
19
27
645
-- Thưa vâng, bạch Thế Tôn.
20
164
809
Tỷ-kheo ấy vâng lời Thế Tôn, đến chỗ Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, sau khi đến, liền nói với Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng:
21
45
854
-- Hiền giả Arittha, bậc Ðạo sư gọi Hiền giả.
22
23
877
-- Thưa vâng, Hiền giả.
23
238
1115
Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, đáp lời Tỷ-kheo ấy, đi đến chỗ Thế Tôn ở, sau khi đến, đảnh lễ Thế Tôn rồi ngồi xuống một bên.
Thế Tôn nói với Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, đang ngồi xuống một bên:
24
121
1236
-- Này Arittha, có thật chăng, Ông khởi lên ác tà kiến như sau:
"Theo như tôi hiểu...
thật sự không có chướng ngại gì"?
25
85
1321
-- Thật sự là vậy, bạch Thế Tôn.
Theo như con hiểu, thật sự không có chướng ngại gì.
26
895
2216
-- Này kẻ ngu si kia, sao Ông lại hiểu pháp Ta thuyết giảng như vậy?
Này kẻ ngu si kia, có phải chăng, Ta đã dùng nhiều pháp môn thuyết chướng đạo pháp.
Và những ai thọ dụng chúng tự đủ bị chướng ngại?
Ta đã thuyết các dục vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
Ta đã thuyết các dục được ví như khúc xương...
Ta đã thuyết các dục được ví như miếng thịt...
được ví như bó đuốc cỏ khô...
được ví như hố than hừng...
được ví như cơn mộng...
được ví như vật dụng cho mượn...
được ví như trái cây...
được ví như lò thịt...
được ví như gậy nhọn...
Ta đã thuyết các dục được ví như đầu rắn, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, và do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
Và này kẻ ngu si kia, không những Ông xuyên tạc Ta, vì Ông đã tự chấp thủ sai lạc, Ông tự phá hoại Ông và tạo nên nhiều tổn đức.
Này kẻ ngu si kia, và như vậy sẽ đưa đến bất hạnh và đau khổ lâu dài cho Ông.
27
28
2244
Rồi Thế Tôn gọi các Tỷ-kheo:
28
154
2398
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng này có thể khởi lên tia lửa sáng gì trong Pháp và Luật này không?
29
68
2466
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, làm sao có thể được!
Không thể được, bạch Thế Tôn.
30
324
2790
Ðược nói vậy, Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, im lặng, hổ thẹn, thụt vai, cúi đầu, lo âu, câm miệng.
Rồi Thế Tôn, sau khi biết được Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng đang im lặng, hổ thẹn, thụt vai, cúi đầu, lo âu, câm miệng, bèn nói với Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng:
31
108
2898
-- Này kẻ ngu si kia, người ta sẽ được biết Ông qua ác tà kiến của chính Ông.
Ở đây, Ta sẽ hỏi các Tỷ-kheo.
32
28
2926
Rồi Thế Tôn gọi các Tỷ-kheo:
33
223
3149
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có hiểu pháp Ta thuyết giảng, giống như Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng này, không những đã xuyên tạc Ta vì đã tự chấp thủ sai lạc, mà còn tự phá hoại mình và gây nên nhiều tổn đức?
34
404
3553
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
Bạch Thế Tôn, Thế Tôn đã dùng nhiều pháp môn thuyết chướng đạo pháp;
và những ai thọ dụng chúng, tự đủ bị chướng ngại.
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn, Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục ví như khúc xương...
(như trên)...
Thế Tôn đã thuyết các dục ví như đầu rắn, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều và do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
35
685
685
-- Lành thay, chư Tỷ-kheo!
Lành thay, chư Tỷ-kheo!
Các Ông hiểu pháp Ta thuyết giảng như vậy.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta đã dùng nhiều pháp môn thuyết chướng đạo pháp, và những ai thọ dụng chúng, tự đủ bị chướng ngại.
Ta đã thuyết các dục vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, và do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
Ta đã thuyết các dục ví như khúc xương...
(như trên)...
Ta đã thuyết các dục ví như đầu rắn, vui ít, khổ nhiều, não nhiều, và do vậy nguy hiểm càng nhiều hơn.
Nhưng Tỷ-kheo Arittha, xưa làm nghề huấn luyện chim ưng, không những xuyên tạc Ta vì đã tự chấp thủ sai lạc mà còn tự phá hoại mình và tạo nên nhiều tổn đức, và như vậy sẽ đưa đến bất hạnh, đau khổ lâu ngày cho kẻ ngu si ấy.
36
139
824
Thật sự, này các Tỷ-kheo, sự kiện này không xảy ra, người ta có thể thọ dụng các dục ngoài các dục, ngoài các dục tưởng, ngoài các dục tầm.
37
15
839
(Ví dụ con rắn)
38
622
1461
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây có một số người ngu si học pháp, như Kinh, Ứng tụng, Giải thuyết, Kệ tụng, Cảm hứng ngữ, Như thị ngữ, Bổn sanh, Vị tằng hữu pháp, Phương quảng.
Sau khi học các pháp này, họ không quán sát ý nghĩa những pháp ấy với trí tuệ.
Những pháp ấy, vì ý nghĩa không được trí tuệ quán sát, nên không trở thành rõ ràng.
Họ học các pháp chỉ vì lợi ích, muốn chỉ trích người khác, chỉ vì lợi ích, muốn khoái khẩu biện luận, và họ không đạt được mục tiêu mà sự học pháp hướng đến.
Những pháp ấy vì nắm giữ sai lạc nên đưa họ đến bất hạnh, đau khổ lâu dài.
Vì sao vậy?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, vì nắm giữ sai lạc các pháp.
39
524
1985
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người ưa muốn rắn nước, tìm cầu rắn nước, đi khắp chỗ để tìm rắn nước.
Người đó thấy một con rắn nước lớn, và người đó bắt con rắn ấy ở lưng hay ở đuôi.
Con rắn ấy có thể quay lại cắn người đó nơi tay, nơi cánh tay hay ở một phần nào khác của cơ thể, và người đó có thể do nhân này mà bị chết hay bị đau khổ gần như chết.
Vì sao vậy?
Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì nắm bắt con rắn một cách sai lạc.
Cũng vậy này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, một số người ngu si học pháp...
Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì sự chấp thủ các pháp sai lạc.
40
596
2581
Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, một số Thiện nam tử học pháp, như Kinh, Ứng tụng, Giải thuyết, Kệ tụng, Cảm hứng ngữ, Như thị ngữ, Bổn sanh, Vị tằng hữu pháp, Phương quảng.
Sau khi học các pháp này, họ quán sát ý nghĩa những pháp ấy với trí tuệ.
Những pháp ấy, vì ý nghĩa được trí tuệ quán sát, nên trở thành rõ ràng.
Họ học pháp không vì lợi ích, muốn chỉ trích người khác, không vì lợi ích, muốn khoái khẩu biện luận, và họ đạt được mục tiêu mà sự học pháp hướng đến.
Những pháp ấy, vì khéo nắm giữ, nên đưa họ đến hạnh phúc, an lạc lâu dài.
Vì sao vậy?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, vì khéo nắm giữ các pháp.
41
527
3108
Chư Tỷ-kheo, ví như một người ưa muốn rắn nước, tìm cầu rắn nước đi khắp chỗ để tìm rắn nước.
Người đó thấy một con rắn nước lớn.
Người đó có thể khéo đè con rắn nước với cây gậy có nạng.
Sau khi khéo đè với cây gậy có nạng, người đó có thể khéo nắm giữ cổ rắn.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, dầu cho con rắn nước ấy có thể cuốn thân nó xung quanh tay, hay cánh tay, hay một thân phần nào khác, người đó cũng không vì nhân duyên ấy đi đến chỗ chết hay đến sự đau khổ gần như chết.
Vì sao vậy?
Chư Tỷ-kheo, vì khéo nắm giữ con rắn nước vậy.
42
314
3422
Cũng vậy, chư Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, một số Thiện nam tử học pháp...
chư Tỷ-kheo, vì khéo nắm giữ các pháp vậy.
Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, hãy hiểu rõ ý nghĩa lời Ta thuyết giảng và thọ trì như vậy.
Nếu có ai không hiểu rõ ý nghĩa lời Ta thuyết giảng thì ở nơi đây, các Ông hãy hỏi Ta hay hỏi những bậc Tỷ-kheo trí thức.
43
16
3438
(Ví dụ chiếc bè)
44
136
3574
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta sẽ giảng pháp cho các Ông, ví như chiếc bè để vượt qua, không phải để nắm giữ lấy.
Hãy nghe và khéo tác ý, Ta sẽ giảng.
45
27
3601
-- Thưa vâng, bạch Thế Tôn.
46
65
3666
Những Tỷ-kheo ấy vâng đáp Thế Tôn.
Thế Tôn thuyết giảng như sau:
47
1140
1140
-- Này các Tỷ-kheo, ví như có người đang đi trên con đường lớn dài, đến một vùng nước rộng, bờ bên này nguy hiểm và hãi hùng, bờ bên kia an ổn và không kinh hãi, nhưng không có thuyền để vượt qua hay không có cầu bắc qua từ bờ này đến bờ kia.
Người đó tự suy nghĩ:
"Ðây là vùng nước rộng, bờ bên này nguy hiểm và hãi hùng, bờ bên kia an ổn và không kinh hãi, nhưng không có thuyền để vượt qua hay không có cầu bắc qua từ bờ này đến bờ kia.
Nay ta hãy thâu góp cỏ, cây, nhánh, lá, cột lại thành chiếc bè, và dựa trên chiếc bè này, tinh tấn dùng tay chân, có thể vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, rồi người đó thâu góp cỏ, cây, nhánh, lá cột lại thành chiếc bè, và nhờ chiếc bè này, tinh tấn dùng tay chân vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn.
Khi qua bờ bên kia rồi, Người đó suy nghĩ:
"Chiếc bè này lợi ích nhiều cho ta, nhờ chiếc bè này, ta tinh tấn dùng tay chân để vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn.
Nay ta hãy đội chiếc bè này trên đầu hay vác nó trên vai, và đi đến chỗ nào ta muốn".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu người đó làm như vậy, thì có làm đúng với sở dụng của chiếc bè chăng?
48
23
1163
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
49
537
1700
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, người đó phải làm thế nào cho đúng sở dụng của chiếc bè?
Ở đây, chư Tỷ-kheo, người đó sau khi vượt qua bờ bên kia, có thể suy nghĩ:
"Chiếc bè này lợi ích nhiều cho ta.
Nhờ chiếc bè này, ta tinh tấn dùng tay chân đã vượt qua bờ bên kia một cách an toàn.
Nay ta hãy kéo chiếc bè này lên trên bờ đất khô, hay nhận chìm xuống nước, và đi đến chỗ nào ta muốn".
Chư Tỷ-kheo, làm như vậy, người đó làm đúng sở dụng chiếc bè ấy.
Cũng vậy, này chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta thuyết pháp như chiếc bè để vượt qua, không phải để nắm giữ lấy.

Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông cần hiểu ví dụ cái bè.
Chánh pháp còn phải bỏ đi, huống nữa là phi pháp.

Này các Tỷ-kheo, có sáu kiến xứ.
Thế nào là sáu?
Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, có kẻ vô văn phàm phu, không đi đến yết kiến các bậc Thánh, không thuần thục pháp các bậc Thánh, không tu tập pháp các bậc Thánh, không đi đến yết kiến các bậc Chơn nhơn, không thuần thục pháp các bậc Chơn nhơn, không tu tập pháp các bậc Chơn nhơn, xem sắc pháp:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi", xem cảm thọ:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi", xem tưởng:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi", xem các hành:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi", xem cái gì được thấy, được nghe, được cảm xúc, được ý thức, được đạt tới, được tìm cầu, được ý suy tư:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi", và bất cứ kiến xứ nào đều nói rằng:
"Ðây là thế giới, đây là tự ngã, sau khi chết, tôi sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không biến chuyển, tôi sẽ trú như thế này cho đến mãi mãi", xem như vậy là:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi".
53
1240
4125
Và này chư Tỷ-kheo, có vị Ða văn Thánh đệ tử đi đến yết kiến các bậc Thánh, thuần thục các pháp bậc Thánh, tu tập pháp các bậc Thánh, đi đến yết kiến các bậc Chơn nhơn, thuần thục pháp các bậc Chơn nhơn, tu tập pháp các bậc Chơn nhơn, xem sắc pháp:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", xem cảm thọ:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", xem tưởng:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", xem các hành:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", xem cái gì được thấy, được nghe, được cảm xúc, được ý thức, được đạt tới, được tìm cầu, được ý suy tư:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", và bất cứ kiến xứ nào đều nói rằng:
"Ðây là thế giới, đây là tự ngã, sau khi chết tôi sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không biến chuyển, tôi sẽ trú như thế này cho đến mãi mãi", xem như vậy là:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi".
Vị này do quán sát như vậy, đối với sự vật chẳng thật có nên không có lo âu, phiền muộn.

Ðược nghe nói vậy, một Tỷ-kheo khác bạch Thế Tôn:
56
71
71
-- Có thể có cái gì không thực có ở ngoài, có thể gây lo âu phiền muộn?
57
12
83
Thế Tôn đáp:
58
347
430
-- Có thể có, này Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, có người nghĩ như sau:
"Cái gì chắc chắn đã là của tôi, nay chắc chắn không còn là của tôi.
Cái gì chắc chắn có thể là của tôi, chắc chắn tôi không được cái ấy".
Người đó sầu muộn, than vãn, khóc lóc, đấm ngực, đi đến bất tỉnh.
Này Tỷ-kheo, như vậy, có cái không thực có ở ngoài, có thể gây lo âu, phiền muộn.
59
91
521
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có thể có cái gì không thực có ở ngoài, có thể không gây lo âu phiền muộn?
60
12
533
Thế Tôn đáp:
61
382
915
-- Có thể có, này Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, này Tỷ-kheo, có người không nghĩ như sau:
"Cái gì chắc chắn đã là của tôi, nay chắc chắn không còn là của tôi.
Cái gì chắc chắn có thể là của tôi, chắc chắn tôi không được cái ấy".
Người đó không sầu muộn, than vãn, khóc lóc, không đấm ngực, không đi đến bất tỉnh.
Như vậy, này Tỷ-kheo, có cái không thực có ở ngoài, không gây lo âu phiền muộn.
62
87
1002
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có thể có cái gì không thực có ở trong có thể gây ra lo âu phiền muộn?
63
12
1014
Thế Tôn đáp:
64
737
1751
-- Có thể có, này Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, này Tỷ-kheo, có người có (tà) kiến như sau:
"Ðây là thế giới, đây là tự ngã, sau khi chết, tôi sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú không biến chuyển.
Tôi sẽ trú như thế này cho đến mãi mãi".
Người này nghe Như Lai hay đệ tử Như Lai thuyết pháp để bạt trừ tất cả kiến xứ, cố chấp, thiên chấp, thiên kiến, tùy miên, sự tịnh chỉ mọi hành động, sự từ bỏ mọi sanh y, sự diệt trừ khát ái đưa đến ly tham, đoạn diệt, Niết-bàn.
Người đó có thể nghĩ như sau:
"Chắc chắn ta sẽ bị đoạn diệt, chắc chắn ta sẽ bị hoại diệt, chắc chắn ta sẽ không tồn tại".
Người đó sầu muộn, than vãn, khóc lóc, đấm ngực, đi đến bất tỉnh.
Này Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là có cái không thực có ở trong có thể gây ra lo âu phiền muộn.
65
88
1839
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có thể có cái gì không thực có ở trong, không gây ra lo âu, phiền muộn?
66
12
1851
Thế Tôn đáp:
67
756
2607
-- Có thể có, này Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, có người không có (tà) kiến như sau:
"Ðây là thế giới, đây là tự ngã, sau khi chết, tôi sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không biến chuyển, tôi sẽ trú như thế này cho đến mãi mãi".
Người này nghe Như Lai hay đệ tử Như Lai thuyết pháp để bạt trừ tất cả kiến xứ, cố chấp, thiên chấp, thiên kiến, tùy miên, sự tịnh chi mọi hành động, sự từ bỏ mọi sanh y, sự diệt trừ khát ái để đưa đến ly tham, đoạn diệt, Niết-bàn.
Vị ấy không nghĩ như sau:
"Chắc chắn ta sẽ bị đoạn diệt, chắc chắn ta sẽ bị hoại diệt, chắc chắn ta sẽ không tồn tại".
Vị ấy không sầu muộn, than vãn, khóc lóc;
vị ấy không đấm ngực, không đi đến bất tỉnh.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là có cái không thực có ở trong, không gây ra lo âu, phiền muộn.

Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thể nắm giữ một vật sở hữu gì, và vật sở hữu được nắm giữ ấy sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không chuyển biến, có thể trú như thế này mãi mãi không?
Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thể thấy một vật sở hữu nào được nắm giữ và vật sở hữu được nắm giữ ấy sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không chuyển biến, có thể trú như thế này mãi mãi không?

-- Lành thay, này các Tỷ-kheo.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta cũng không thấy một vật sở hữu được nắm giữ nào, mà vật sở hữu được nắm giữ ấy sẽ thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không chuyển biến, có thể trú như thế này mãi mãi.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thể chấp thủ Ngã luận thủ nào mà Ngã luận thủ ấy được chấp thủ như vậy lại không khởi lên sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não không?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thấy Ngã luận thủ nào mà Ngã luận thủ ấy được chấp thủ như vậy lại không khởi lên sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não không?

-- Lành thay, này các Tỷ-kheo.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta cũng không thấy Ngã luận thủ nào mà Ngã luận thủ ấy được chấp thủ như vậy lại không khởi lên sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não.
Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có kiến y nào, mà kiến y ấy được y chỉ như vậy lại không khởi lên sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não không?
Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông có thấy kiến y nào, mà kiến y ấy được y chỉ như vậy lại không khởi lên sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não không?

75
219

-- Lành thay, này các Tỷ-kheo!
Này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta cũng không thấy một kiến y nào, mà kiến y ấy được y chỉ như vậy, lại không khởi lên sầu, bi, khổ, ưu, não.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu có ngã thời có ngã sở thuộc của tôi không?
76
20
239
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có.
77
63
302
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu có ngã sở thuộc, thời có ngã của tôi không?
78
20
322
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, có.
79
338
660
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu ngã và ngã sở thuộc không thể được chấp nhận là thường còn, thường hằng, thì kiến xứ này:
"Ðây là thế giới, đây là tự ngã, sau khi chết tôi sẽ thành thường còn, thường hằng, thường trú, không biến chuyển, tôi sẽ trú như thế này cho đến mãi mãi".
Này các Tỷ-kheo, kiến xứ ấy là hoàn toàn, triệt để chẳng ngu si không?
80
70
730
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, làm sao có thể hoàn toàn, triệt để chẳng ngu si được!
81
71
801
-- Này các Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Sắc là thường hay vô thường?
82
27
828
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, vô thường.
83
35
863
-- Cái gì vô thường là khổ hay lạc?
84
21
884
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, khổ.
85
156
1040
-- Cái gì vô thường, khổ, chịu sự biến hoại, thì có hợp lý chăng khi chánh quán cái ấy là:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi"?
86
23
1063
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
87
48
1111
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, cảm thọ là thường hay vô thường?
88
30
1141
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, là vô thường.
89
35
1176
-- Cái gì vô thường là khổ hay lạc?
90
24
1200
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, là khổ.
91
131
1331
-- Cái gì vô thường, khổ, chịu sự biến hoại thì có hợp lý chăng khi chánh quán cái ấy là:
"Cái này là của tôi...
tự ngã của tôi"?
92
23
1354
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
93
46
1400
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, tưởng là thường hay vô thường?
94
27
1427
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, vô thường.
95
23
1450
-- Cái gì vô thường...?
96
23
1473
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
97
95
1568
-- Chư Tỷ-kheo, các hành là thường hay vô thường...
chư Tỷ-kheo, thức là thường hay vô thường?
98
27
1595
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, vô thường.
99
35
1630
-- Cái gì vô thường là khổ hay lạc?
100
21
1651
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, khổ.
101
136
1787
- Cái gì vô thường, khổ thì có hợp lý chăng, khi chánh quán cái ấy là:
"Cái này là của tôi, cái này là tôi, cái này là tự ngã của tôi"?
102
23
1810
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
103
608
2418
-- Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, bất cứ các sắc pháp nào, quá khứ, tương lai, hiện tại, nội hay ngoại, thô hay tế, liệt hay thắng, xa hay gần;
tất cả sắc pháp là:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", cần phải như thật quán với chánh trí tuệ.
Bất cứ cảm thọ nào...
Bất cứ tưởng nào...
Bất cứ hành nào...
Bất cứ thức nào, quá khứ, vị lai, hiện tại, nội hay ngoại, thô hay tế, liệt hay thắng, xa hay gần, tất cả thức là:
"Cái này không phải của tôi, cái này không phải là tôi, cái này không phải tự ngã của tôi", cần phải như thật quán với chánh trí tuệ.
104
393
2811
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nhờ thấy vậy, vị Ða văn Thánh đệ tử yểm ly đối với sắc, yểm ly đối với thọ, yểm ly đối với tưởng, yểm ly đối với hành, yểm ly đối với thức, do yểm ly nên ly tham, do ly tham, nên được giải thoát, trong sự giải thoát có trí khởi lên, biết được đã giải thoát.
Vị ấy biết:
"Sanh đã tận, phạm hạnh đã thành, những gì nên làm đã làm, không còn trở lui tại đây với một đời sống khác".

Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo ấy được gọi là vị đã vất bỏ đi các chướng ngại vật, là vị đã lấp đầy các thông hào, là vị đã nhổ lên cột trụ, là vị đã mở tung các lề khóa, là bậc Thánh đã hạ cây cờ xuống, đã đặt gánh nặng xuống, không có gì hệ lụy.
107

3347
Và thế nào là Tỷ-kheo đã vất bỏ đi các chướng ngại?
Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, là đã đoạn trừ vô minh, cắt tận gốc rễ, làm cho như cây ta-la bị chặt đầu, khiến không thể tái sanh trong tương lai, không có khả năng sanh khởi.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là Tỷ-kheo đã vất bỏ đi các chướng ngại.
108
322
3669
Này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là Tỷ-kheo đã lấp đầy các thông hào?
Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo đã đoạn trừ tái sanh và sự luân chuyển sanh tử, đã cắt tận gốc rễ, làm cho như cây ta-la bị chặt đầu, khiến không thể tái sanh trong tương lai, không có khả năng sanh khởi.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là Tỷ-kheo đã lấp đầy thông hào.

Này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là Tỷ-kheo đã nhổ lên cột trụ?

110
307
307
Này các Tỷ-kheo, thế nào là Tỷ-kheo đã mở tung các lề khóa?
Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo đã đoạn trừ năm hạ phần kiết sử, đã cắt tận gốc rễ, làm cho như cây ta-la bị chặt đầu, khiến không thể tái sanh trong tương lai, không có khả năng sanh khởi.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là Tỷ-kheo đã mở tung các lề khóa.

Ở đây, này các Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo đã đoạn trừ ngã mạn, đã cắt tận gốc rễ, làm cho như cây ta-la bị chặt đầu, khiến không thể tái sanh trong tương lai, không có khả năng sanh khởi.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, như vậy là vị Tỷ-kheo bậc Thánh, đã hạ cây cờ xuống, đã đặt gánh nặng xuống, không có gì hệ lụy.
112
293
1000
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Tỷ-kheo đã giải thoát như vậy, thì chư Thiên ở Ðế thích Thiên giới, Phạm thiên giới, Sanh chủ giới sẽ không tìm được dấu vết của Tỷ-kheo ấy, nếu nghĩ rằng:
"Y ở đây, có thức của Như Lai".
Vì sao vậy?
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta nói ngay ở hiện tại, một Như Lai không thể tìm thấy dấu vết".

(Xuyên tạc Như Lai)

1513
Chư Tỷ-kheo, Ta nói như vậy, thuyết như vậy, một số Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn xuyên tạc Ta một cách phi chơn, hồ đồ, hư vọng, không thực:
"Sa-môn Gotama chủ trương chủ nghĩa hư vô, đề cao đoạn diệt, hủy diệt, sự tiêu diệt các hữu tình".
Nhưng này các Tỷ-kheo, Ta không là như vậy, Ta không nói như vậy, Ta không như các Sa-môn, Bà-la-môn ấy đã xuyên tạc một cách phi chơn, hồ đồ, hư vọng, không thật:
"Sa-môn Gotama chủ trương chủ nghĩa hư vô, đề cao đoạn diệt, hủy diệt, sự tiêu diệt các hữu tình".
115
631
2144
Chư Tỷ-kheo, xưa cũng như nay, Ta chỉ nói lên sự khổ và sự diệt khổ.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu ở đây những người khác nhiếc mắng, phỉ báng, làm cho Như Lai tức giận, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây, Như Lai không có sân hận, không có bất mãn, tâm không phẫn nộ.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu ở đây, những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái, cúng dường Như Lai, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây Như Lai không có hoan hỷ, sung sướng, Tâm không thích thú.
Chư Tỷ-kheo, nếu những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái, cúng dường Như Lai, thì này các Tỷ-kheo, ở đây Như Lai suy nghĩ:
"Ðây là điều xưa kia đã từng biết rõ:
ở đây là trách nhiệm Ta phải làm".
116
533
2677
Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu có những người khác nhiếc mắng, phỉ báng, làm cho các Ông tức giận, ở đây các Ông chớ có sân hận, bất mãn, tâm chớ khởi phẫn nộ.
Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu có những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái cúng dường các Ông, thì ở đây, các Ông chớ có hoan hỷ, sung sướng, tâm sanh thích thú.
Do vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, nếu có những người khác cung kính, tôn trọng, lễ bái cúng dường các Ông, thì ở đây, các Ông hãy suy nghĩ:

Chư Tỷ-kheo, các Ông nghĩ thế nào?
Trong rừng Jetavana này, nếu có người thâu lượm cỏ, cây, nhành, lá rồi đốt hay làm với chúng tùy theo ý muốn, các Ông có nghĩ chăng?
Người ấy thâu lượm chúng ta, đốt chúng ta hay làm với chúng ta tùy theo ý muốn?
120
108
3887
-- Bạch Thế Tôn, không.
Vì sao vậy?
Bạch Thế Tôn, vì nó không phải tự ngã hay không phải sở thuộc của ngã.
121

-- Cũng vậy, này các Tỷ-kheo, cái gì không phải của các Ông, các Ông hãy từ bỏ.
